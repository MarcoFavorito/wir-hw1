                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Most     of     the
                   works  regarding  complexity  results  for  concept  languages  consider  Subsumption  as  the  prototypical  inference.  However,  the
                   basic deductive service of a concept-based knowledge base is the
                   so-called Instance Checking, which is the problem of checking if
                   an individual is an instance of a given concept. We analyze the
                   Instance Checking problem, providing algorithms for its solution
                   and  results  for  its  intrinsic  complexity  in  the  various  concept
                   languages. The central question we address is whether Instance
                   Checking can be easily reduced to Subsumption. We single out
                   languages  for  which  Instance  Checking  is  strictly  harder  than
                   Subsumption, as well as languages for which Instance Checking
                   can be solved by relying on Subsumption algorithms. This analysis highlights a new source of complexity in concept languages.<p>
                   A practical implication of this fact is that any actual deduction
                   procedure for reasoning in concept-based systems has to embed
                   some reasoning mechanisms that are not reducible to Subsumption. Further, we address various issues associated with the semantics of knowledge bases and queries. In particular, we study
                   the possibility of modifying the Instance Checking problem to the
                   case in which the knowledge base and the concept representing
                   the query are expressed in different languages. We introduce an
                   epistemic operator that makes the query facilities to go beyond
                   the first-order setting of concept languages. We show that epistemic queries may have both a natural interpretation and good
                   computational properties. We also show how the epistemic operator gives us the ability to formalize some procedural mechanism


                   usually employed in actual systems, namely integrity constraints
                   and trigger rules.<p>
