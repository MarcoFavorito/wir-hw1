                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>It  is  a  common
                   opinion  that  subsumption  is  the  central  reasoning  task  in
                   frame-based knowledge representation languages (or concept languages). Intuitively, a concept C subsumes another concept D if
                   the set of objects represented by C is a superset of the one represented by D. When individual objects are taken into account,
                   the basic deductive task for retrieving information from a knowledge base is instance checking, that amounts to checking whether
                   the knowledge base implies that an individual is an instance of a
                   given concept. In this paper, we address the question of whether
                   instance checking can be solved by means of subsumption algorithms.  We  do  so  by  considering  several  languages  where  subsumption belongs to different complexity classes. For such languages  we  present  methods  for  the  instance  checking  problem,
                   provide  a  complexity  analysis  of  this  problem,  and  compare  it
                   with the subsumption problem. The main result of the paper is
                   that instance checking is not always easily reducible to subsumption.  In  particular,  there  are  cases  where  it  is  strictly  harder
                   than subsumption. This impacts on the design of reasoning algorithms for knowledge representation systems based on concept
                   languages.<p>
