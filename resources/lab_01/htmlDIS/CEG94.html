                   in NMR has focused largely on the idea of representing knowledge about the world via rules that are generally true but can
                   be defeated. Even if relational databases are nowadays the main
                   tool for storing very large sets of data, the approach of using nonmonotonic formalisms as relational database query languages has
                   been investigated to a much smaller extent. In this work we propose a novel application of default logic by introducing a default
                   query  language  (DQL)  for  finite  relational  databases,  which  is
                   based  on  default  rules.  The  main  result  of  this  paper  is  that
                   DQL is as expressive as SO98 , the existential universal fragment
                   of second order logic. This result is not only of theoretical importance:  We show queries -which are useful in practice- that can
                   be expressed with DQL and cannot with other query languages
                   based on non-monotonic logics such as DATALOG:stable. Another


                   result in this paper concerns the combined  complexity of DQL,
                   i.e., when it is assumed that the query is part of the input; for
                   this problem, NEXPTIMENP  -completeness is shown.<p>
