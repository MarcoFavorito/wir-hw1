							<p class="subtitle">EU-Publi.com (IST/2001/35217)</p>
							<p><em>Project funded by the European Community</em></p>
							<p>The EU-PUBLI.COM project aims at implementing a "secure Intranet" that can interconnect at the application level the ISs of public administrations across several European countries. We call this network Unitary European Network (UEN). Besides providing the essential interconnection services (e-mail, file transfer, etc.) to administrations by supplying them with basic interoperability tools, the project aims at defining an Unitary European Network Architecture as a whole, by bringing together the collection of distributed, autonomous systems of each administration into a common Cooperative Architecture. In turn, this will make it possible to develop new and reengineer the existing global European administrative processes by making more effective use of the information made available by each individual system.</p>

							<p class="subtitle">MAIS</p>
							<p><em>Project funded by MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita' della Ricerca)</em></p>
							<p>The current trend in the communication world suggests that an information system should offer continuous access to all information sources, from all locations, through various kind of devices (PCs, laptops, palmtops, cellular phones, TV sets, etc.). Moreover, users are interested in a wider and wider variety of services enabling access to any kind of data, also with transactional properties and complex interaction (home-banking, e-business, online reservation, mobile information systems, etc.). Then the problem to allow accesses to services from current user location and through different telecommunication networks with a given level of QoS arises.</p>
							<p>The goal of the MAIS project is the development of models, methods and tools to implement a Multichannel Adaptive Information System able to provide services with respect to different types of networks and access devices.</p>
							<p>Then the main problems faced will be (i) adaptivity, which provides flexibility even in presence of a variety of technological platform and user requirements and (ii) transactionality, which provides security and reliability also in presence of failure or service unavailability. In particular will be developed an enabling platform to build distributed information systems with the above specified features. Then the platform should enable the execution of the services also on terminal devices, that may consequently work in the systems as server, also in condition of network fault, with distributed mechanisms of service composition. A seamless behaviuor of the system should be also enabled, in order to perform the service on several terminals, adapting as far as possible the service to the device type and communication channel features; service execution on the user side should also be performed with transactional protocol.</p>

							<p class="subtitle">IS-MANET</p>
							<p>The IS-MANET project aims at realizing an infrastructure for the interconnection of MANETs (mobile ad-hoc networks) via satellite links. This infrastructure will be used to realize a prototype of an application for the management of environmental emergencies by "Protezione Civile". This application field presents a context in which the fluid and reconfigurable communication infrastructure provided by MANETs becomes fundamental.</p>
							<p>The project aims at developing innovative solutions at each system level; at application level, showing the powerful characteristics of MANETs; at the software architecture level developing advanced solutions for middleware and new design methodologies adapted to peer-to-peer environments; finally, at the communication support layer, the project will face the problems related to message routing on MANETs. </p>

							<p class="subtitle">Software infrastructure for ad-hoc networking</p>
							<p><em>Project funded by MIUR ("Fondo speciale enti di ricerca")</em></p>
							<p>The project goals is to develop innovative solutions for ad-hoc networking from applications to network infrastructures. From applications viewpoint, we want to show the MANET potentiality in a few hostile contexts. Then we want to provide advanced middleware platforms and software methodologies to support such ad-hoc networking. One of our aims is to show that these solutions can be employed even in wired networks. From the networking viewpoint we investigate innovative routing and end-to-end TCP protocol for mobile ad hoc networking.</p>

							<p class="subtitle">DaQuinCIS: Methodologies and tools for data quality in cooperative information systems</p>
							<p><em>Project funded by MIUR (Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universita' della Ricerca) which involves three Italian universities: University of Rome "La Sapienza", Politecnico di Milano</em>, University of Milan "Bicocca".</p>
							<p>Even though there are techniques and methodology to improve data quality within a single autonomous system, up to now, there does not exist any proposal that defines an integrated framework to improve data quality in cooperative environments. The study of such an integrated framework that answers previous question is the main target of this project. The framework includes:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>an integrated methodology;</li>
								<li>specific methodologies for the single phases that characterize the measurement and improvement process of the quality of data;</li>
								<li>measurement and correction techniques;</li>
								<li>reference of a "data quality" distributed architecture that exposes "ad-hoc" services to allow local data quality improvement.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The definition of the integrated methodology is an ambitious objective, that implies the integration of competence from different research areas: databases, distributed systems and information systems. This methodology should define a long-term reference (extendible in the next years) that allows to place the contribution of the three research units with respect to the project phases. Moreover, the integrated methodology should lead to the definition of an ad-hoc distributed architecture which includes (i) the definition of the representation models for data quality information that flows between different organizations and (ii) the design of a middleware that offers services to the single organizations for the transmission of data and their quality degree, for the localization of data with high quality and for the consistency of replicated data. In cooperative information systems, data replication is one of the key issues. Many organizations can keep the same data under heterogeneous representations. There exists then a non-trivial problem of data alignment (consistency) and data updating.</p>

							<p class="subtitle">IRL - Interoperable Replication Logic</p>
							<p><em>Project funded by the University of Rome "La Sapienza"</em></p>
							<p>The Interoperable Replication Logic (IRL) architecture is a Fault Tolerant CORBA compliant infrastructure exploiting a three-tier approach to replicate stateful CORBA objects. IRL is interoperable, as clients and server replicas lay on standard ORBs implementing only the IIOP protocol.</p>

							<p class="subtitle">Consulting activities</p>
							<p>The introduction of object oriented, group and middleware technologies in mission critical applications, such as Air Traffic Control, have becoming more pervasive due to the need of interoperability among parts of the systems developed by different vendors and to reduce the cost of software development and maintenance. We are analyzing how these technologies can play a synergic role in achieving previous goals.</p>

							<p class="subtitle">MIDAS (IST/2001/37610)</p>
							<p><em>Project funded by the European Community</em></p>
							<p>MIDAS is funded by <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/fp5/about.htm" target="_blank">the European Union's Fifth Framework Programme in Research and Technological Development</a>(FP5). FP5 is coming to an end, and work has begun to identify new proposals to be funded under <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/fp6/index_en.html" target="_blank">the Sixth Framework Programme</a> (FP6). FP6 will run for four years, from 2003-2006. The aim of MIDAS is to prepare a roadmap for the development of new project proposals in the area of middleware. It will run for one year, from 1st June 2002 - 31st May 2003. A ubiquitous computing environment will be required to realize the Sixth Framework Programme vision of ambient intelligence; in such an environment processors will be everywhere and will be interconnected by a diverse array of networks, from ad-hoc to the global Internet. Constructing the software infrastructure for the ubiquitous computing environment poses a number of scientific and technical challenges. A fundamental requirement is for middleware architectures capable of supporting services that are composable and adaptable. The objectives of MIDAS are (i) to create a research roadmap for the development of the next generation middleware capable of supporting services that are composable and adaptable within the context of large scale systems where quality of service issues ranging from fault-tolerance, timeliness to security and survivability are of paramount importance; and (ii) to build Europe wide partnerships for creating an integrated project (IP) for future work in this area in the forthcoming FP6.</p>

							<p class="subtitle">Time in Distributed Systems</p>
							<p><em>JOINT CNR/CNRS Project</em></p>
							<p>The project analyzes different degrees of synchronization in a distributed system to understand the ordering relations among events generated at different sites in distributed systems. This is a fundamental problem when designing distributed applications. The project compares lazy protocol scheme with aggressive ones. Lazy protocols use only control information attached to messages while aggressive protocols exchange control messages to keep their internal clocks within a certain degree of accuracy.</p>
