Recent technological achievements require advances beyond the existing
computational models in order to be used effectively. We shall
investigate different models and provide new fundamental results and
methods of general use. Pragmatic aspects of current and future
computer systems will be modelled so that realistic estimates of
efficiency can be given for algorithms in these new settings. First,
we shall investigate physical realisations of PRAM properties, e.g.,
optical technology for concurrent memory access, and consider the
power of some novel models such as the PRAM with I/O, parallel quantum
computers, or ``molecular'' computers.  Second, we shall seek detailed
models, like BSP and LogP, to represent the capabilities of existing
machines and draw programmers' attention to important implementation
aspects.  Third, we shall examine reliability and robustness questions
for the various models, with random structures and probabilistic
analysis playing a crucial role.  Inseparable from the work on models
is the development of new algorithms to exploit the power of certain
models, and the exploration of the relationships between different
models.  We shall develop basic algorithms that support efficient use
of massively parallel computers, e.g., synchronisation protocols,
virtual shared-memory models, mapping of a process graph onto a given
parallel architecture, routing and load balancing, and central
communication tasks like broadcasting or gossiping.  The results
achieved within this area will influence the development of parallel
operating systems as described in Section <A 
HREF="node17.html#technology">1.3</A>. Our
algorithms will be designed and analysed both for the standard PRAM
model and the more detailed models mentioned above.  Performance and
analysis will be experimentally tested using FRAMES.  The algorithms
will be made available by developing an experimental library of basic
PRAM algorithms and data structures, called <b> PADPAD</b> (for <em> 
PRAM
Algorithms and Data structures</em>), using a language environment
designed by research groups at the universities of Saarbr&#252;cken and
Trier.  An important target architecture will be the PRAM being
constructed by W. Paul's group at Saarbr&#252;cken.
