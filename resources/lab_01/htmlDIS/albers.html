We present the first comprehensive experimental study  of online algorithms
for Graham's scheduling problem. In Graham's scheduling problem, which is a 
fundamental and extensively studied problem in scheduling theory, a sequence
of jobs has to be scheduled on $m$ identical parallel machines so as to
minimize the makespan. Graham gave an elegant algorithm that is
(2-1/m)-competitive. Recently a number of new online algorithms were
developed that achieve competitive ratios around 1.9. Since competitive
analysis can only capture the worst case behavior of an algorithm a question
often asked is: Are these new algorithms geared only towards a pathological
case or do they perform better in practice, too?

We address this question by analyzing the algorithms on various job sequences.
We have implemented a general testing environment that allows a user
to generate jobs, execute the algorithms on arbitrary job sequences and obtain
a graphical representation of the results. In our actual tests, we analyzed
the algorithms (1) on real world jobs  and (2) on jobs generated by
probability distributions. It turns out that the performance of the
algorithms depends heavily on the characteristics of the respective work
load. On job sequences that are generated by standard probability
distributions, Graham's strategy is clearly the best. However, on the
real world jobs  the new algorithms often outperform Graham's
strategy. Our experimental study confirms theoretical results and gives some
new insights into the problem. In particular, it shows that the techniques
used by the new online algorithms are also interesting from a practical
point of view.
