  This paper presents theoretical results and techniques for representing and
  managing task network goals in the framework of partial order planning.
  Task oriented formalisms are more expressive than partial order based
  formalism for problem goals in dynamical and changing domains, but they
  are not more powerful. We prove that it is always possible to express a task
  network problem in terms of an equivalent problem stated in partial order
  planning formalism. The task network model has been extended to describe
  external events (EETN), a feature not present in many planning models.
  The equivalence between this new model and PO formalism is also proved.
  These results allow to reuse existing partial order planners as tools in order
  to solve task network goals. We introduce a linear cost technique of domain
  transformation which compiles a given task domain in an equivalent
  operator based domain which is then submitted to a nonlinear planner. This
  technique has been successfully demonstrated by the implementation of a
  EETN planner based on domain tranformations for UCPOP.
