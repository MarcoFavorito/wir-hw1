        <p>&quot;There are lots of things to like about this book. In
        particular, I liked the appendix on element s of linear systems
        theory.... Then there is the clear enthusiasm of the authors for the
        subject...useful for self study or as a supplement in a more advanced
        course...&quot; (<i>SIAM Review</i>, Vol. 43, No. 3)
        <p>&quot;Very well-written and well-organized. Suitable for students
        who have had a first course in differential equations.&quot; (<i>American
        Mathematical Monthly</i>, January 2002)</p>
        <p>&quot;The style of the book is rather informal but not imprecise, and
        the authors really succed in conveying their enthusiasm and the flavor
        of the subject. I consider this book a welcome introduction to the
        theory and applications of positive linear systems&quot; (<i>Zentralblatt
        Math</i>, Vol. 988, No. 13)</p>
        <p>&quot;There are three type of readers to the book: one who researches
        positive systems, one who is familiar with linear system theory, and one
        who is familiar with applications of positive systems: the books
        benefits a person of each of the three types in its own way. [...] I
        strongly recommend the book because it covers important properties of
        positive systems, and it includes wide range of applications.&quot; (<i>Automatica</i>, Vol.39, pp. 367, 2003)</p>
        <p>&quot;The exposition of the topics is consistent and clear. The book
        is addressed to graduate students, scientists and engineers in
        control.&quot; (<i>Mathematical Reviews</i>, Issue 2001g)</p>
