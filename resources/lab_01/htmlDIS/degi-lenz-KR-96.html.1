A Description Logic (DL) system is characterized by four fundamental aspects:
the set of constructs used in concept and role expressions, the kind of
assertions allowed in the TBox (assertions on concepts) and the ABox
(assertions on individuals), and the inference mechanisms for reasoning on
both the TBox and the ABox. Most of the research done in the last decade in
DLs made several simplifying assumptions on the above aspects. However, the
recent interest in DLs exhibited in many application areas (databases, software
engineering, intelligent access to the network, planning, etc.) calls for
investigating DL systems with full capabilities. The work presented in this
paper represents a step in this direction. We present a sound, complete, and
terminating (in worst-case EXPTIME) inference procedure that solves the
problem of reasoning in a DL system with the following characteristics: it
comes equipped with a very expressive language, it allows the most general
form of TBox assertions, and it takes into account instance assertions on both
concepts and roles in the ABox.
