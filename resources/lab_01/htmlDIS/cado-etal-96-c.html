Many reasoning tasks in logics for commonsense reasoning have been shown to
be computationally intractable in the worst case. However, However, realistic
applications of KR require the ability to handle large knowledge bases, which
require efficient and reliable algorithms. A first step in the development of
algorithms which are efficient in the average case is to single out those cases
which appear in practice to require more computational resources. The goal of
our investigation is to perform experimental studies on sophisticated KR
formalisms, similar to those performed for classical logic. In particular, in this
paper we analyze modal and non-monotonic logics.
