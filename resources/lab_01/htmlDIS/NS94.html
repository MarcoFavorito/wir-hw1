                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Applications  developed  by  end-users  using  spreadsheets  cannot  be  effectively
                   distributed  to  other  users  because  of  the  need  of  adequate  information on the functioning of the applications themselves. In
                   fact,  building an explanation facility to support an application
                   is a time consuming task. This paper illustrates the realization
                   of a tool for the automatic generation of explanations in conventional spreadsheet applications. The system works in two stages:
                   the first one corresponds to the construction of a knowledge base
                   containing the information on the mathematical relations coded
                   into a programmed spreadsheet;  the second one consists of the
                   generation of explanations concerning the quantities used in the
                   spreadsheet and their relationships, from the representation previously built.<p>
