Description logics (also called terminological logics, or concept languages) are
fragments of first-order logic that provide a formal account of the basic
features of frame-based systems. However, there are aspects of frame-based
systems_such as non-monotonic reasoning and procedural rules_that cannot
be characterized in a standard first-order framework. Such features are needed
for real applications, and a clear understanding of the logic underlying them is
necessary for principled implementations. In this paper we show how
description logics enriched with an epistemic operator can formalize such
aspects. The logic obtained is a fragment of a first-order non-monotonic modal
logic. We show that the epistemic operator formalizes procedural rules, as
provided in many knowledge representation systems, and enables sophisticated
query formulation, including various forms of closed-world reasoning. We
provide an effective procedure for answering epistemic queries posed to a
knowledge base expressed in a description logic and extend this procedure in
order to deal with rules. We also address the computational complexity of
reasoning with the epistemic operator, identifying cases in which an
appropriate use of the epistemic operator can help in decreasing the
complexity of reasoning.
