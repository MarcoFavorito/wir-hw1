Many formalisms for reasoning about knowing commit an agent to be logically
omniscient. Logical omniscience is an unrealistic principle for us to use to
build a real-world agent, since it commits the agent to knowing infinitely many
things. A number of formalizations of knowledge have been developed that
don't ascribe logical omniscience to agents. With few exceptions, these
approaches are modifications of the "possible-worlds" semantics. In this paper
we introduce two general techniques for building non-omniscient reasoners.
The first technique is to provide, by using reification, for the explicit
representations of notions, such as problems, solutions, and problem solving
activities, usually left implicit in the discussions of autonomous agents. The
second technique is to take explicitly into account the notion of resource when
we formalize reasoning principles. We use the notion of resource to describe
interesting principles of reasoning that can be used for ascribing knowledge to
agents. For us, resources are abstract objects. We have made extensive use of
ordering and inaccessibility relations on resources, but we have not found it
necessary to define a metric on resources. Using principles about resources
without assigning a metric is one of the strengths of our approach. We
describe the architecture of a finite reasoner who solves a puzzle on reasoning
about knowing by explicitly using the notion of resource. Our approach allows
us to use axioms ordinarily used in problem solving -such as axiom K of
modal logic- without being forced to attribute logical omniscience to any
agent. In particular we address the issue of how we can attribute knowledge to
others using resource-unbounded (e.g., logically omniscient) reasoning without
introducing contradictions. We do this by showing how such ideas can be
introduced as a conservative extension over resource-bounded reasoning.
