  This paper proposes an uniform framework for the proof theory of tractable
  approximations of propositional reasoning. The key idea is the introduction
  of approximate proofs. This makes possible the development of an
  approximating sequent calculus for propositional deduction where proofs
  can besound, complete or multi-directional approximations of classical logic.
  We show how this calculus subsumes existing approaches to approximation
  such as the BCP-k family of anytime reasoners by Dalal and S-1,S-3
  entailments by Cadoli and Schaerf.
