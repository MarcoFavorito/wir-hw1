A basic feature of Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems is to
represent knowledge by means of taxonomies, here called terminologies, and to
provide a specialized reasoning engine to do inferences on these structures.
The taxonomy is built through a representation language called concept
language (or description logic), which is given a well-defined set-theoretic
semantics.  The efficiency of reasoning has often been advocated as a primary
motivation for the use of such systems.  The main contributions of the paper
are:  (1) a complexity analysis of concept satisfiability and subsumption for a
wide class of concept languages; (2) algorithms for these inferences that
comply with the worst-case complexity of the reasoning task they perform.
