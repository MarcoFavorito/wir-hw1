<H2>Abstract </H2>
<P>
We study reasoning in Levesque's logic of only knowing.  In particular, we
first prove that extending a decidable subset of first-order logic with the
ability of reasoning about only knowing preserves decidability of
reasoning, as long as quantifying-in is not allowed in the language,
and define a general method for reasoning about only knowing in such a
case.  Then, we show that the problem of reasoning about only knowing in
the propositional case lies at the second level of the polynomial
hierarchy. Thus, it is as hard as reasoning in the majority of
propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning, like default logic,
circumscription, and autoepistemic logic, and it is easier than reasoning
in propositional formalisms based on the minimal knowledge paradigm, which
is strictly related to the notion of only knowing. Finally, we identify a
syntactic restriction in which reasoning about only knowing is easier than
in the general propositional case, and provide a specialized deduction
method for such a restricted setting.
