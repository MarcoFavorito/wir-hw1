A propositional knowledge base can be seen as a compact
representation of a set of models.   When a knowledge base T is
updated with a formula P, the resulting set of models can be
represented in two ways:   either by a theory T' that is
equivalent to T*P or by the pair (T,P). The second representation
can be super-polinomially more compact than the first.   In this
paper, we prove that the compactness of this representation
depends on the specific semantics of *, e.g., Winslett's
semantics is more compact than Ginsberg's.
