  We investigate the epistemological properties of MKNF, Lifschitz's logic of
  minimal knowledge and negation as failure. In particular, we show that the
  expressive power of MKNF is equivalent to Moore's autoepistemic logic
  (AEL), by defining an embedding of MKNF into AEL and vice versa. We
  also prove that the negation as failure modality not of MKNF exactly
  corresponds to the negative introspection operator in AEL. The two
  previous results imply that MKNF's minimal knowledge modality K can be
  represented by means of negation as failure not, i.e. MKNF theories admit
  an equivalent representation in terms of unimodal theories using the not
  operator only. This in turn implies that negation as failure is "more
  expressive" than minimal knowledge.
