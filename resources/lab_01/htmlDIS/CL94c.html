                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>ISA   and   cardinality constraints are among the most interesting types of constraints  in  data  models.  ISA  constraints  are  used  to  establish
                   several  forms  of  containment  among  classes,  and  are  receiving  great  attention  in  moving  to  object-oriented  data  models,
                   where classes are organized in hierarchies based on a generalization/specialization principle. Cardinality constraints impose restrictions on the number of links of a certain type involving every
                   instance of a given class, and can be used for representing several
                   forms of dependencies beteewn classes, including functional and


                   existence dependencies. While the formal properties of each type
                   of constraints are now well understood, little is known of their interaction. The goal of this paper is to present an effective method
                   for reasoning about a set of ISA and cardinality constraints in the
                   context of a simple data model based on the notions of classes and
                   relationships. In particular, the method allows one both to verify
                   the satisfiability of a schema and to check whether a schema implies a given constraint of any of the two kinds. We prove that the
                   method is sound and complete, thus showing that the reasoning
                   problem for ISA and cardinality constraints is decidable.<p>
