Independence---the study of what is relevant to a given problem
of reasoning---is an important AI topic.   In this paper, we
investigate several notions of conditional independence in
propositional logic:   Darwiche and Pearl's conditional
independence, and some more restricted forms of it.   Many
characterizations and properties of these independence relations
are provided.   We show them related to many other notions of
independence pointed out so far in the literature (mainly
formula-variable independence, irrelevance and novelty under
various forms, separability, interactivity).   We identify the
computational complexity of conditional independence and of all
these related independence relations.
