                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this paper we
                   discuss  ground  logics,  a  family  of  nonmonotonic  modal  logics,


                   with the goal of using them in knowledge representation. Ground
                   logics  are  based  on  the  idea  of  minimizing  the  knowledge  expressed by non-modal formulae. The nonmonotonic character of
                   the  logics  can  be  described  either  by  a  fix-point  equation  that
                   introduces assumptions on the non-modal part of the theory, or
                   by means of a preference relation on possible-worlds models. We
                   address both the epistemological and the computational properties of ground logics. We discuss the representational features by
                   providing a thorough comparison between them and McDermott
                   and Doyle logics. We find that there are a number of interesting
                   notions that are nicely captured by ground logics. Particularly
                   interesting is the ground logic for S5. We show that reasoning
                   in ground logics is  p3-hard. Moreover we prove that  p3 is also
                   an upper bound for reasoning in the major ground logics. Moreover,  we  identify  some  special  cases  of  practical  interest  where
                   the complexity of reasoning in ground logics is lower than in the
                   general case.<p>
