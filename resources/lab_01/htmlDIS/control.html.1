<P>
A fuzzy controller, based on 
<A HREF="http://www.ai.sri.com/~konolige/saphira">
software developed at SRI International</A>,
is responsible for the reactive behavior of the robot.
</P>

<P>
Inside the fuzzy controller, primitive actions are mapped into
<I>behaviors</I>, which are basic control activities. Behaviors are
distinguished in reactive ones, like avoiding obstacles, and (low-level)
goal-oriented ones, like following a corridor.  A blending mechanism is
used to integrate reactive and goal-oriented behaviors, so that the robot
can follow a corridor while avoiding obstacles.<BR>

In practice, each behavior is implemented by a set of fuzzy rules
specifying control actions to be performed in determined situations.
<!--
For example, the Avoid-Collision behavior includes a rule like
<P>
IF collision-right AND NOT collision-left THEN turn-left
</P>
where collision-right and collision-left are fuzzy variables
and turn-left is the control action. An activity level computed from
evaluation of rule antecedent is associated with the control action. The
activity level measures how much the control action is desirable in the
current situation.

Integrated routines for sonar sensor interpretation, map building,
and navigation are also present.
