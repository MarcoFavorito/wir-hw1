                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this paper we
                   present a general framework for representing agents in interactive
                   systems.  We  propose  it  as  a  basic  tool  for  modelling  students
                   within Intelligent Tutoring Systems. This framework turns out
                   to be very suited for applications where the perceptions of the
                   system about users are taken into account in order to make the
                   interaction more effective and individualized, on the basis of their
                   needs and characteristics. Appealing to the situation calculus, we
                   present a general classification of the knowledge involved in the
                   process of modelling agents, in particular students of Intelligent
                   Tutoring Systems. Then, we discuss the various representational
                   issues introduced and provide a formal semantics. The framework
                   presented is very general in that it can represent various kinds
                   of  Adaptive  Interactive  Systems  and  is  able  to  cope  with  the
                   multi-agent case.<p>
