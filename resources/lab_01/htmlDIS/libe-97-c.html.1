Belief revision and belief update are two different forms of belief change, and
they serve different purposes. In this paper we focus on belief update, the
formalization of change in beliefs due to changes in the world. The complexity
of the basic update (introduced by Winslett [1990]) has been proved by Eiter
and Gottlob (1991). Since then, many other formalizations have been proposed
to overcome the limitations and drawbacks of Winslett's update. In this paper
we analyze the complexity of the proposals presented in the literature, and
relate some of them to previous work on closed world reasoning.
