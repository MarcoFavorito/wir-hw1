Many recent works point out that there are several possibilities of assigning a
meaning to a concept definition containing some sort of recursion. In this
paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we
achieve a better result by adopting a formalism allowing for different semantics
to coexist. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we present a
knowledge representation language with the above characteristics. The
language is a powerful concept language where, besides the usual constructs
for conjunction, disjunction, negation, and quantifiers, both qualified number
restrictions, and recursive definitions are allowed. Notably, these features
make our formalism one of the most powerful concept languages proposed in
literature, in which the usual frame-based descriptions can be combined with
definitions of data structures such as lists, directed acyclic graphs, streams,
etc. We show that reasoning in our language is decidable, and we characterize
its computational complexity by resorting to a correspondence with the modal
mu-calculus interpreted over deterministic structures.
