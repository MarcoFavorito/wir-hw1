(DSP):</H4>

<P>DSP is an extension of the environment-based simulation tool DSS developed
in ALCOM and ALCOM II. DSP will strongly enhance the executable specification
language of DSS to allow the description and execution of distributed algorithms
and protocols (including protocols for hierarchical networks, very fast
networks, and heterogeneous networks with mobile users). The DSP library
then aims at containing tested and validated (through the simulation part
of DSP) protocols, ranging from basic protocols, e.g., for network control,
to complicated ones, e.g., wait-free objects, admission control in very
fast networks, etc. Thus, non-expert users will be provided with a tool
to specify their distributed algorithm for the network they wish, and to
execute it to test its correctness and performance. </P>

<UL>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/new.gif" HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=28>DSP
is designed to provide</P>

<UL>
<LI>a clear and well accepted model of a distributed system (DSP model)
that abstracts away specific characteristics of different distributed platforms,
and therefore, gives a unified framework for the design, analysis, verification
and programming of general distributed protocols and algorithms. </LI>

<LI>a library (of LEDA philosophy) of distributed data types and algorithms
in a form that allows them to be used by non-experts and algorithms designers
(DSP library). </LI>
</UL>

<P>The success of the von Neumann model for sequential computation is attributable
to the fact that it is an efficient bridge between software and hardware.
An analogous bridging model for parallel computation has been proposed
by L. Valiant (the bulk- synchronous parallel model - BSP). The situation
in the study and design of distributed algorithms is less clear. Several
different models of distributed information processing are frequently used
in the design of such algorithms. The DSP platform aims in providing a
simple, general enough model, which is well accepted by algorithms designers
and seems to be a viable candidate for the role of a bridging model of
distributed computation. The adoption of such a model can be expected to
insulate software and hardware developments from one another and make possible
both general purpose distributed systems and transportable software. The
DSP model follows the principles proposed by the books of <I>G.Tel &quot;Introduction
to Distributed Algorithms&quot;</I> and <I>N.A.Lynch &quot;Distributed
Algorithms&quot;</I> and aims in describing precisely and concisely the
relevant aspects of a whole class of distributed computing systems. A distributed
computation is considered today to be a collection of discrete events,
each event being an atomic change in the state of the whole system. This
notion is captured by the definition of transmission systems. What makes
such a system distributed is that each transmission is only influenced
by, and only influences, part of the state, basically the local state of
a single process. In DSP, each process (mode) is represented by a finite
state machine with a local transmission table. Events affecting transmissions
include the arrival of a message at a node, time-outs, node (and link)
failures and mobile process movement. The power of the nodes is not limited
in any other way since they are allowed to have local memory and (unbounded)
local registers. The general model adopted by DSP supports many interesting
variations (all are tuneable by the user): </P>

<UL>
<LI>Non determinism (by allowing the designer of a protocol to specify
a time distribution for the processing steps of a node and/or the message
transmission delays of links). </LI>

<LI>General topologies of networks (node interconnections). </LI>

<LI>Asynchronous, perfectly synchronous or limited asynchronous computations
with clean semantics in each case. </LI>

<LI>A clean and abstract failure model for nodes and links (permanent,
temporary or malicious failures).</LI>

<LI>Clear semantics for fairness in computations, safety and liveness.
</LI>

<LI>A simple message passing subsystem with clean robustness properties
and user-defined message types.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The platform allows in addition the modelling of mobile processes, the
concurrent execution of more then one distributed algorithms in co-operation
(e.g. a leader election protocol with a routing protocol or a synchronizer)
and user control of local (virtual) clocks. The DSP platform thus differs
from all existing ``simulators'' or ``languages'' of distributed systems
because of its generality, algorithmic simplicity and clarity of semantics
of its supported features. It aims in providing to the distributed algorithms
designer an ideal environment of what a general distributed system ``is
expected to be''. </P>

<P>The kernel of the platform is an event driven simulator where all future
events are tagged with a global time to happen (universal time) not known
to the simulated protocols (global event queue). In addition, an algorithmic
language for distributed protocols (DSPL) is provided. This is a simple
algorithmic language without hidden attributes, capable of describing algorithms
``close'' to their theoretical description. Also, a simple, high-level,
topology description language (TOPL) which allows the designer to describe
any general network topology, even hierarchical ones. Finally, a graphical
user interface with animation features for the examination of distributed
algorithms evolution on small topologies. The DSP will be enhanced with
a meta-language aiming at verification of algorithms correctness at a high
level (by using the clean semantics of low level mechanisms, for example
messages). <BR>
