We present two concept languages, called PL  1 and PL  2, which are extensions
of FL  -. We prove that the subsumption problem in these languages can be
solved in polynomial time. Both languages include a construct for expressing
inverse roles, which has not been considered up to now in tractable languages.
In addition, PL  1 includes number restrictions and negation of primitive
concepts, while PL  2 includes role conjunction and role chaining. By exploiting
recent complexity results, we show that none of the constructs usually
considered in concept languages can be added to PL  1 and PL  2 without losing
tractability. Therefore, on the assumption that languages are characterized by
the set of constructs they provide, the two languages presented in this paper
provide a solution to the problem of singling out an optimal trade-off between
expressive power and computational complexity.
