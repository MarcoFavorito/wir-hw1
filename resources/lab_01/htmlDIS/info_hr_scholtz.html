<h1>Designing for situation awareness</h1>

<a href="pres/scholtz.ppt">Download the presentation (PPT, PowerPoint)</a>

<p>User interfaces for robots, specifically search and rescue robots, are not yet well defined.  Researcher has just begun to combine results in human-computer interaction, monitoring autonomous systems, and situation awareness and to conduct empirical studies for human-robot interaction. This lecture will cover basic principles of human-computer interaction, automation studies, and designing for situation awareness.  Some specific guidelines for HRI have been developed based on recent studies and data collection efforts.  These will be discussed and will be used as the basic for designing widgets for a standard robot interface.  Some examples of user interfaces will be shown and discussed.</p>

<p>Presentation is only one portion of human-robot interaction.  The lecture will also cover mixed-initiative interaction and a discussion of when it is appropriate for the robot to make decisions and suggestions and when the operator should make these decisions.  This will also include switching between different levels of autonomy and what affordances need to be provided for operators who have to intervene when an autonomous action fails.  </p>

<p>A final section of the lecture will look at various ways to assess the human-robot interface.  This will cover some standard usability practices as well as more specific HRI evaluations such as awareness and critical incidents.</p>

<h2>Plan for practical sessions</h2>

<p>We will use the Iconnect software and will develop several basic modules that can be incorporated into a basic layout.  We will connect our UI to the robot from the Franhofer Institute.  </p>

<p>We will develop a basic layout and modules for video display with sensor overlays; a monitor panel for robot health; displays for camera information, robot shape and position information.   We will develop controls for camera position and interactions for switching between three levels of autonomy.  </p>

<p>I have the Iconnect software on my laptop and can provide this to others in the group.  Assuming we have 10 or so in the group, the idea would be to divide up into smaller groups of 3 and give each group a particular module to develop.  We will alternate group coding sessions with whole group design sessions and critique sessions.</p>
