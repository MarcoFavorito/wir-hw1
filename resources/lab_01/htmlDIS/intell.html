    A topic of research has been the study of a framework for the construction
of Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) as a particular case study to represent a
system providing consultation, presentation, help, training and tutoring about
a specific domain.<p>
    Recently, this study has been carried forward in <A HREF="EM94.html">[EM94]</A> where the role of
Student  Modeling  in  ITS  and  the  implications  of  this  research  area  for  User
Modeling are explored.  In particular, the focus is on systems which take into
account user modeling in order to make the interaction more suited to the user
own  needs  and  characteristics.  Some  existing  ITSs  are  examined  and  a  general framework of student modeling, based on first order logic, is presented and
analyzed with respect to user modeling techniques.  This general framework is
further analyzed in <A HREF="Err95.html">[Err95]</A> to represent agents in interactive systems.  This approach has been pursued within the situation calculus for a general classification
of the knowledge involved in the process of modeling multi-agent case.<p>
    Relevant possibilities of industrial application can be found in the study of
a general framework for the automatic generation of ITS from a given application.  Indeed building an explanation facility to support an application is a time
consuming task.  In particular, the research have focussed on the realization of
a tool for the automatic generation of explanations in conventional spreadsheet
applications <A HREF="NS94.html">[NS94]</A>.  The system works in two stages:  at first it constructs a
knowledge base for the mathematical relations coded into a programmed spread

sheet; then it uses this knowledge base to generate the explanations concerning
quantities and relationship used in the spreadsheet.  The system has then been
extended in <A HREF="LNS95.html">[LNS95]</A> in order to generate automatically two kinds of support
that  can  make  the  application  self-instructive:  a  hyper-textual  guide  and  an
interactive tutor.<p>
    Finally, another approach to the development of Intelligent Systems can be
found in <A HREF="EN94.html">[EN94]</A> which presents KAAD, a support system for architectural design
based on a new methodology.  It enhances its capabilities of generation, support
and verification of design solutions by shaping the activity of design into three
phases:  definition of the required functional services (objectives), production of
design solutions and evaluation of provided services in relation to objectives.  It
makes use of a simple frame-based language that has turned out to be very well
suited for this purpose.<p>
