  Traditionally spacecraft operations are automated by increasing the levels of
  automation in the ground segment. Certain missions, however, are only
  possible with high levels of on-board automation and autonomy with
  respect to the ground. These include missions to distant planets and bodies
  for which the light or radio signal travel time is too long to accommodate
  real time control and where the spacecraft spends long periods of time out
  of sight of ground stations. This paper reports on work done within the
  scope of the spacecraft autonomy research project which has as one
  objective to investigate architecture for on-board autonomy. The paper
  describes the autonomous spacecraft architecture and focuses on the
  on-board decision making mechanism. A highly decentralised and
  distributed architecture was adopted. The autonomous spacecraft is
  modelled as a collection of intelligent sub-systems that must co-operate to
  achieve goals. The decentralised nature of the system implies a heavy
  reliance on communication for the co-ordination of actions, a mechanism for
  continued co-ordination in the event of failure resulting in incomplete and
  uncertain spacecraft status information is described.
