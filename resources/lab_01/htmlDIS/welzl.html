<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
<br>
We are given a finite set of points in the plane and a vertical 
directed line that does not have all points on one side.
We want to find `ways' to the first edge connecting two
points in the set met by the line. We analyze two randomized 
processes motivated by LP-related problems; in particular, if
the appropriate higher-dimensional generalizatiions are considered.
The first process describes what is known as the multiple pricing 
heuristics in linear programming, and it is a simplified
variant of a previously analyzed algorithm by Clarkson. The second 
process describes the so-called random edge pivot rule for the 
simplex method. Since we illustrate the methods in the planar
scenario, no geometric or LP-specific pre-knowledge is 
required. In fact, we will show that almost identical tools as 
we use them here appear, e.g., in minimum spanning tree computations.
