  The behavior of verbs in sublanguages is highly specific and does not follow
  general principles of lexical decomposition. NLP applications require specific
  lexicons for tasks like surface parsing and shallow semantic interpretation.
  The reduced set of verbal senses specific to a given domain is more
  appropriate for efficient processing in real world tasks (e.g. information
  extraction and retrieval). In this paper a method for learning verb
  subcategorization patterns from corpora is proposed. Conceptual clustering
  techniques are applied to the results of surface parsing in order to extract
  relevant domain typical senses and automatically build a lexicon of
  subcategorization frames. The aim is to learn a core of lexico-grammatical
  knowledge suitable to support more sophisticated parsing strategies to be
  applied in a target NLP application. Results derived for the Italian language
  from several corpora are presented.
