Much of the research on concept languages, which are also called
terminological languages, has focused on the computational complexity of
subsumption.  The intractability results can be divided into two groups.  First,
it has been shown that extending the basic language F LMIN         with constructs
containing some form of logical disjunction leads to co-NP-hard subsumption
problems.  Secondly, adding negation to F LMIN         makes subsumption
PSPACE-complete.  The main result of this paper is that extending F LMIN
with unrestricted existential quantification makes subsumption NP-complete.
This is the first proof of intractability for a concept language containing,
whether explicitly or implicitly, no construct expressing disjunction.
Unrestricted existential quantification is therefore, alongside disjunction, a
source of computational complexity in concept languages.
