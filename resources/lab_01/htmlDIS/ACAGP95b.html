                   logics  characterized  by  a  class  of  frames  satisfying  the  insertion property are shown to be suitable for Reiter's default logic.<p>
                   The canonical fix point construction defined by Marek, Schwarz
                   and Truszczynski for Reiter's default logic is refined and a new
                   paradigm  for  nonmonotonic  logic  is  addressed.Suitable  modal
                   logics for such a construction must contain KD4. When reflexivity is added to the modal logic used for the fix point construction
                   then the Marek Schwarz and Truszczynski framework for Reiter's
                   default logic is obtained. The framework proposed is appropriate also when the family of modal logics in between S4 and S4f
                   are used. If, instead, reflexivity is dropped, then a new family of
                   modal logics is gained, namely the modal logics in between KD4
                   and KD4Z. The upper bound can be extended to the modal logic
                   KD4LZ whenever the propositional language taken into account
                   is finite.<p>
