Mesa was originally designed for Unix/X11 systems and is still best supported on
those systems. All you need is an ANSI C compiler and the X development environment
to use Mesa. Others have contributed drivers for the Amiga, Apple Macintosh, BeOS,
NeXT, OS/2, MS-DOS, VMS, Windows 9x/NT, and Direct3D. See the README file included
with the Mesa distribution for more details.
</P>

<P>
The standard Mesa distribution only supports software-based rendering, with
the exception of the 3Dfx Glide driver.
Information about other hardware support follows.

		<P>The <A HREF="http://dri.sourceforge.net" target="_parent">DRI architecture</A>,
		originally developed by Precision Insight, Inc. uses Mesa and
                provides hardware acceleration for a number of popular chipsets.<BR>
		<BR>
		The DRI is part of XFree86 4.0 and later.
                <BR><BR>
                If you download and install XFree86 4.x you do not need to
                install Mesa separately.  All the important parts of Mesa
                will be installed with the rest of XFree86.

		<P>All cards based on these chipsets should work with Linux and
                Windows 95 via 3dfx's Glide library.
		The Mesa/Glide driver is included with the Mesa distribution.
                You'll need to install the Glide header files and runtime library.

		David Bucciarelli wrote the original 3dfx driver for Mesa.<BR>
		Daryll Strauss ported Glide to Linux.

download and install NVIDIA's OpenGL library.  You may however, want to download
Mesa in order to use its GLU and GLUT libraries, or assorted demo programs.</P>
