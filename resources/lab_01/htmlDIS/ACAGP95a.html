                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>We    present    a
                   general proof theoretical methodology for default systems. Given
                   a default theory <W; D>   , the default rules D  are simply understood  as  restrictions  on  the  tableaux  construction  of  the  logic.<p>
                   Different default approaches have their own way of understanding these restrictions and executing them. For each default approach  (such  as  Reiter,  Brewka  or  Lukaszewicz),  the  allowable
                   default extensions can be obtained from the default tableau construction. The advantage of our approach, besides being simple
                   and neat, is in its generality:  it allows for the development of a
                   default theory for any logic with a tableau formulation, such as
                   intuitionistic logic, linear logic or modal logic.<p>
