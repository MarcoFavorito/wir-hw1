<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>Silvio Salza was born in Rome on
March 5, 1948.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>He got a master degree in Electrical
Engineering summa cum laude in 1973 from the University of Rome “La Sapienza”,
and a&nbsp; postgraduate degree in Computer and System Science from the
same University in 1974.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>From 1975 to 1991 he has been with
the Italian National Research Concil, where since 1986 has been head of
the Data and Knowlwdge Base group at the Istituto di Analisi dei Sistemi
ed Informatica (IASI-CNR) in Rome.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>In 1979 and 1980 he has been on
leave from CNR and has joined as a post-doc fellow the IBM T.J.Watson Research
Center in Yorktown Heigths, NY.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>Since 1991 he is with the University
of Rome "La Sapienza". In the last years he has devoted most of his time
to the teaching activity. He currently gives courses on Computer Architectures,
Operating Systems and Database Systems.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>His main research interest is the
design and evaluation of large database systems. From an original background
in queueing theory and mathematical modelling of computer systems, he has
later moved to problems related to the performance analysis of database
systems, as&nbsp; evaluation of query execution costs and analysis and
statistical characterization of database application workload. Related
activities concern design and management of large data repositories, evaluation
of parallel and distributed database systems, and query optimization in
database systems.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>More recently his research interests
have extended to the areas of computer networks, workflow management systems,
and data warehousing and data mining.</font></font>
<p><font color="#000080"><font size=+1>He has been involved in several
national and international projects corcerning the design of advanced database
system. His main activities in these projects have been related to architecture
design, workflow analysis, and performance evaluation and prediction through
mathematical models.</font></font>
