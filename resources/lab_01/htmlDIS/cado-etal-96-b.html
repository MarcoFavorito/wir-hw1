We investigate the space efficiency  of a Propositional Knowledge
Representation (PKR) formalism.   Informally, the space efficiency
of a formalism F  in representing a certain piece of knowledge ff,
is the size of the shortest formula of F  that represents ff.   In
this paper we assume that knowledge is either a set of
propositional interpretations or a set of formulae (theorems).
We provide a formal way of talking about the relative ability of
PKR formalisms to compactly represent a set of models or a set of
theorems.   We introduce two new compactness measures, the
corresponding classes, and show that the relative space
efficiency of a PKR formalism in representing models/theorems is
directly related to such classes.   In particular, we consider
formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning, such as circumscription
and default logic, as well as belief revision operators.
