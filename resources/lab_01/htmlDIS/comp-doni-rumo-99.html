Most of present intelligent knowledge management environments for
conceptual modelling and analysis suffer, in our opinion, from mixing two
representation levels: (1) a conceptual level, where domain-specific concepts
are represented (e.g. data and processes in Data-Flow Diagrams); (2) an
epistemological level, where inferences are drawn from domain-independent
linguistic constructors (e.g. concepts and roles in Description Logics). We



propose an engineering approach to the development of new systems, where
the two levels are separately represented and are either linked by the protodl
methodology or by concept emulators. We exemplify our approach by
modelling Data-Flow Diagrams in level (1) and by using a Description Logic
with a Closed Terminology Assumption in level (2). The benefit of the
proposed approach lies in decoupling the conceptual level from the underlying
epistemological level in the overall architecture of support tools for the
construction and the analysis of large domain models. This implies easy
replacement of different inferential engines at the epistemological level, while
retaining the same domain description at the conceptual level.
