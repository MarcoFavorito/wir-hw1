The DRS (Data Relay Satellite) System is a European Space Agency
communication system whose management is particularly complex.
Nevertheless the particular domain of application is an example of problems
that are becoming quite common in the communication scenarios enables by
current technology. This paper describes a system named DRS-Sched, a
knowledge-based scheduler aimed at solving a conspicuous aspect of the whole
DRS scheduling problem. In particular, the problem model addressed is rather
distinctive: the activities to be scheduled have a temporal flexibility over both
their allocation and duration intervals, and temporal preference functions over
the allocation interval. Problem solving in DRS-Sched integrates domain
specific predictive scheduling heuristics, that built a solution using a least
commitment approach, and reactive heuristics, that try to improve the current
schedule by locally modifying previous choices when a particular class of
conflicts arises. The paper describes the problems addressed and the basic
algorithm and heuristics used in the current release of the system. An
experimental evaluation is also presented showing how the system satisfies
quality requirements connected to different relevant aspects of the project.
