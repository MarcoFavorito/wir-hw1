<h3>To mock a mockingbird - and other logic puzzles<br>
by Raymond Smullyan</h3>

If you are new to Smullyan and his puzzles this book is not a bad place to start from. You will find a great deal of logic problems regarding truth-tellers and liars, such as: "Person A says that at least one of A and B is a liar (never tells the truth). Is A a liar? And what about B?". This is the simplest type of puzzle; many are much more challenging.
<p>
If you already read some of Smullyan's books, be assured that this one has the same appeal. Some of the knight-knaves puzzles are similar to the ones in "What is the name of this book?" and "Alice in puzzle-land" but there are important variations such as day-knights and night-knights and there is also some challenging metapuzzle.
<p>
The second half of the book leaves the island of knights and knaves to enter an enchanted forest of talking birds. Though I found this part somewhat difficult to get in, once you work carefully your way through the first chapter you will find it fascinating. At the end you will have solved a lot of interesting problems and explored a subject called combinatory logic which has important applications in modern logic. As Smullyan puts it, "what could be better for a puzzle book?"

<h3>Forever undecided - a puzzle guide to Gödel<br>
by Raymond Smullyan</h3>

Another great puzzle book from the well-known logician Raymond Smullyan. The first half of the book
is full of puzzles regarding truth-tellers and liars, much as in Smullyan's other books. 
The second part is what makes the book unique since it is a series of puzzle introducing
worlds of Reasoners and eventually leading to some of the most important modern
achievements in logics like Kripke semantics and Gödel's incompleteness theorem.
Though these achievements involve some very deep ideas about reasoning and logic,
Smullyan makes it really accessible for anyone which has the patience to follow him.
