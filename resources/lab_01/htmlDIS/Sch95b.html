                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Two   main   approaches have been followed in the literature to give a semantics
                   to non-Horn databases. The first one is based on considering the
                   set of rules composing the programs as inference rules and interpreting the negation in the body as failure to prove. The other
                   approach is based on the so-called closed-world assumption and
                   its objective is to define a stronger notion of consequence from a
                   theory than the classical one, where, very roughly, negative information can be inferred whenever its positive counterpart cannot
                   be deduced from the theory. In this work we generalize the semantics for negation in logic programs, putting together the constructive nature of the rule-based deductive databases with the
                   syntax-independence of the closed-world reasoning rules. These
                   generalized semantics are shown to be a well-motivated and wellfounded alternative to closed-world assumptions since they enjoy
                   nice semantic and computational properties.<p>
