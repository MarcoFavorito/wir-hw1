                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this work, the
                   problem  of  performing  abduction  in  modal  logics  is  addressed,
                   along the lines of a previuos paper, where a proof theoretical abduction method for full first order classical logic is defined, based
                   on  tableaux  and  Gentzen-type  systems.  This  work  applies  the
                   same  methodology  to  face  modal  abduction.  The  non-classical
                   context  enforces  the  value  of  analytical  proof  systems  as  tools
                   to face the meta-logical and proof-theoretical questions involved
                   in abductive reasoning. The similarities and differences between
                   quantifiers and modal operators are investigated and proof theoretical  abduction  methods  for  the  modal  systems  K,  K4,  D,
                   D4,  T  and  S4  are  defined,  that  are  sound  and  complete.  The
                   construction  of  the  abductive  explanations  is  in  strict  relation
                   with the expansion rules for the modal logics, in a modular manner that makes local modifications possible. The method given
                   in this paper is general, in the sense that it can be adapted to
                   any  propositional  modal  logic  for  which  analytic  tableaux  are
                   provided. Moreover, the way towards an extension to first order
                   modal logic is straightforward.<p>
