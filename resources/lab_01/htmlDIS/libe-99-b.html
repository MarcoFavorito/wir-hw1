Reasoning, Action, and Change (NRAC'99)</i><p>
Three distinct operations have been introduced so far to the
extent of amalgamating knowledge coming from different sources:
revision, merging, and update.   In this paper we present a
framework in which it is possible to perform these three
operations at the same time.   We show some examples in which this
is actually necessary, and thus cannot be dealt by existent
systems.   The framework has been implemented, and the examples
shown in this paper (as well as other examples from the belief
revision literature) have been successfully tested.   To our
knowledge, this is the first implemented system able to perform
revision, merging, and update at the same time.
