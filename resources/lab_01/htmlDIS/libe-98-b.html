The problem of minimally modifying a plan in response to changes
in the specification of the planning problem has already been
investigated in the literature.   In this paper we consider the
problem of non-minimal modification of plans from a computational
point of view.   We prove that while the general problem is
intractable (that is, replanning from scratch is equally hard),
there are scenarios in which the new plan can be built more
efficiently (in polynomial time).
