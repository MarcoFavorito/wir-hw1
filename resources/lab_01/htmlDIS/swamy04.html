  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stochastic optimization problems 
    attempt to model uncertainty in the data by assuming that (part of) the input 
    is specified in terms of a probability distribution, rather than by deterministic 
    data given in advance. We consider the well-syudied paradigm of 2-stage models 
    with recourse, where one takes decisions in two steps: first, given only distributional 
    information about (some of) the data one commits on initial actions, and then 
    once the actual data is realized (according to the distribution), further 
    (recourse) actions can be taken. These problems are often computationally 
    quite difficult, both from a practical perspective, as well as from the point 
    of view of complexity theory. We give the first approximation algorithms for 
    2-stage stochastic optimization problems with recourse for which the underlying 
    random data is given by a "black box" and no restrictions are placed on the 
    costs of the two stages, based on an approximation scheme for a linear programming 
    (LP) relaxation of the problem. A significant difficulty encountered, is that 
    the LP relaxation of the stochastic problem may have an exponential number 
    of variables and constraints, and might not be solvable in polynomial time; 
    in fact, even evaluating the objective function may be #P-hard. In this talk, 
    I will describe the algorithm used to solve these exponential size LPs, and 
    show how this can be applied to design approximation algorithms for some applications 
    such as the stochastic versions of the set cover, vertex cover and facility 
    location problems. <br>
