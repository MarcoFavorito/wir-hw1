<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
<br>
A design at all levels of the abstraction hierarchy from functional
specification to final implementation) is generally represented as a set
of components, which can be considered as isolated monolithic blocks,
which interact with each other and with an environment that is not part of
the design.  The model of computation defines the behavior and interaction
of these blocks. Compactness of description, fidelity to design styles,
ability to simulate, synthesize to an appropriate implementation and
optimize its behavior are criteria to follow for the choice of an MOC to
describe and manipulate a design.  For example, some MOCs are suitable for
describing complicated data transfer functions and completely unsuitable
for complex control, while others are designed with complex control in
mind. We review the foundations of a theory of models of computation
(MOC). We will try to convey the basic notions and definitions to avoid
ambiguity that often arises when MOCs are used in a non-rigorous fashion.
We describe problems related to the mapping of these models into efficient
implementations, in particular scheduling and partitioning.
