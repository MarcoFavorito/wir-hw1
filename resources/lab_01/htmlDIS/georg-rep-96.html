We show that Gabbay's nonmonotonic consequence relations can be reduced
to a new family of relations based on the notion of expectation. Expectation
relations provide a direct generalization of epistemic entrenchment and
expectation ordering introduced by G&auml;rdenfors and Makinson for the
study of expectation inference and belief revision, respectively.
