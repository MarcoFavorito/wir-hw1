The m\times n     TP has~ m supply points and~ n demand points. Each supply point i holds a     quantity r_i&gt;0 , and each demand point j wants a quantity c_j&gt;0 , with     \sum \limits_{i=1}^m r_i = \sum \limits_{j=1}^n c_j . A solution to the problem     can be written as a m\times n matrix X with entries decision variables x_{ij}     having value equal to the amount transported from supply point i to demand     point j . The objective is to minimize total transportation costs \sum\limits_{i=1}^m\sum\limits_{j=1}^n     t_{ij} x_{ij} , where t_{ij} is the unit transportation cost from supply point     i to demand point j . The set of feasible solutions of TP, is called the transportation     polytope. The 1-skeleton (edge graph) of this polytope is defined as the graph     with vertices the vertices of the polytope and edges its 1-dimensional faces.     In 1957 W.M. Hirsch stated his famous conjecture (cf. [Dantzig, 1963]) saying     that any d -dimensional polytope with n facets has diameter at most n-d .     So far the best bound for any polytope is O(n^{\log d+1}) [Kalai and Kleitman,     1992]. Any strongly polynomial bound is still lacking. Such bounds have been     proved for some special classes of polytopes (for examples, see [Schrijver,     1995]). Among those are some special classes of transportation polytopes [Balinski,     1974], [Bolker, 1972] and the polytope of the dual of TP [Balinski, 1974].     The first strongly polynomial bound on the diameter of the transportation     polytope was given by Dyer and Frieze [DyerFrieze, 1994]. Actually, they prove     a bound on the diameter of any polytope \{x\in\R^n\mid Ax\leq b,\ b\in\R^m\}     where A is a totally unimodular matrix. The proof is complicated and indirect,     using the probabilistic method. Moreover, the bound is huge ( O(m^{16}n3(\ln(mn))3)     assuming m\leq n ). We will give a simple proof that the diameter of the transportation     polytope is less than 8(m+n-2) . The proof is constructive: it gives an algorithm     that describes how to go from any vertex to any other vertex on the transportation     polytope in less than 8(m+n-2) steps along the edges.<BR>    &nbsp; </P>  <p></P></DL>
