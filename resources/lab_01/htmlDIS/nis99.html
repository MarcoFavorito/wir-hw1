<h1>Data integration and reconciliation in Data Warehousing:
Conceptual modeling and reasoning support</h1>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p>
Integration is one of the most important aspects of a Data Warehouse.  When
data passes from the sources of the application-oriented operational
environment to the Data Warehouse, possible inconsistencies and
redundancies should be resolved, so that the warehouse is able to provide
an integrated and reconciled view of data of the organization.  We describe
a novel approach to data integration and reconciliation, based on a
conceptual representation of the Data Warehouse application domain. The
main idea is to declaratively specify suitable matching, conversion, and
reconciliation operations to be used in order to solve possible conflicts
among data in different sources. Such a specification is provided in terms
of the conceptual model of the application, and is effectively used during
the design of the software modules that load the data from the sources into
the Data Warehouse.
