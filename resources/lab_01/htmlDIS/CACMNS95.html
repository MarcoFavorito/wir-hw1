                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In
                   knowledge representation several formalisms for reasoning about
                   knowledge in a multi agent scenario have been proposed. More
                   specifically, we can identify a family of languages based on the
                   use  of  a  modal  operator  and  another  one  based  on  the  use  of
                   first-order logic enriched with meta-level capabilities. In this paper  we  consider  these  two  approaches  by  addressing  the  issues
                   of consistency that arise from self-referenciality, their expressiveness and the methods for translating classical modal systems into
                   meta-level first-order formalisms.<p>
