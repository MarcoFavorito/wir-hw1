<p class="Normale" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normale" style="text-align: justify;">Throughout my research
career I have addressed various research issues in a wide variety of
domains: theory of programming, database theory, computational
complexity, algorithmics, discrete optimization. The domains in which I
see my major contributions and which still form my main research
interest, are the domains concerning the approximate solution of
NP-hard optimization problems and the design of advanced algorithms.
The major results in such domains can be summarized as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="Normale"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Approximability
of NP-hard optimization problems</span>: in this field, we have
addressed the problem of the approximability of NP-hard optimization
problems, with the aim to characterize those problems that can be
efficiently approximated and those problems that are hard to
approximate and to establish relationships between structural and
approximability properties of problems. In particular, we introduced
for the first time new measures of the quality of approximation and the
notions of structure preserving reducibility and of approximation
preserving reducibility, we proved the existence of complete problems
in the class of NP optimization problems, we studied the power of
approximation techniques such as local search and greedy algorithms.</li>
  <li class="Normale"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dynamic
and on-line algorithms</span>: in the field of dynamic graph algorithms
we have been among the first researchers to address the problem of
efficiently maintaining graphs in a dynamic setting, in which edges
can be inserted and/or deleted, and, in particular, to provide
efficient algorithms for maintaining shortest paths. In the field of
on-line algorithms we have addressed some on line versions of the
traveling salesman problem, laying down the foundations for a large
number of subsequent papers, by various authors, devoted to on line
vehicle routing problems.</li>
  <li class="Normale"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Directed
hypergraph algorithms</span>: we have introduced the notion of directed
hypergraph (a generalization of directed graphs) and studied the
complexity and the design of efficient algorithms for static and
dynamic solutions of the transitive closure, the transitive reduction,
the shortest hyperpath problem. Such algorithms have been applied to a
wide variety of problems such as minimization of functional dependency
in databases, satisfiability of propositional Horn clauses and truth
maintenance in fuzzy Horn logics.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Corpo\20 del\20 testo">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Corpo\20 del\20 testo">Beside the main research contributions
related to the above mentioned fields we have also contributed to the
following domains:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="Normale">in theory of programming we designed and
developed the first LISP interpreter in Italy and took part in the
development of one of the earliest symbolic manipulation systems; we
studied the relationship between the computation models of LISP, of
lambda calculus and of related algorithmic languages such as the
language CUCH designed by Corrado B&ouml;hm; we studied the modeling of
parallel computing in lambda calculus and we provided one of the first
treatment of symbolic manipulation systems in the framework of abstract
data types;</li>
  <li class="Normale">in computational complexity we proposed a
variation of Blum's axioms for abstract complexity measures in such a
way to make possible to give a more appropriate treatment of space-like
resources; we addressed the study of the complexity of functions
defined by multiple recurrence relations; also, for the first time, we
applied Gold's notion of limiting approximation in the context of the
complexity classes P and PSPACE;</li>
  <li class="Normale">in database theory we have addressed the problem
of establishing equivalence among databases both from an intensional
and from an extensional point of view; we have addressed the problem of
determining minimum equivalent database schemes; we have studied the
problem of acyclicity in database schemes;</li>
  <li class="Normale">in the field of graph algorithms we have
addressed optimum graph searching problems,  related to web exploration.</li>
</ul>
