<p>The talk gives a detailed introductory description of a novel technique to create a global map of robots' surroundings by converting the raw data acquired from a scanning sensor to a compact map composed of just a few generalized polylines (polygonal curves). The new approach proposed merges maps acquired by multiple independent robots, it is composed of a local geometric process of merging similar line segments (termed Discrete Segment Evolution) with a global statistical control process.</p>

<p>In the case of single robot, it is able to incrementally build a map showing the environment the robot has traveled through by merging global maps with actual scans. In the case of a robot team, it is able to identify common parts of their partial maps and, if common parts are present, construct a joint map of the explored environment.</p>
