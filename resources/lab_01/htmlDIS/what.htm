</font><font face="Arial Narrow">
<br>
The terminology was proposed for the first time by David Luenberger in
his celebrated textbook “Introduction to Dynamic Systems” (Wiley,
1979). To quote Chapter 6, entitled “<i>Positive linear systems</i>”: a
positive linear system is a linear system in which the state
variables are always positive (or at least nonnegative) in value.<br>
<br>
Notably, positivity of the variables often emerges as the immediate
consequence of the nature of the phenomenon itself so that this
information is immediately available. A large number of evidences
are just before our eyes: any variable representing any possible
type of resource measured by a quantity such as time, money and
goods, buffer size and queues, data packets flowing in a network,
human, animal and plant populations, concentration of any
conceivable substance you may think of and also - if you haven't
conceived this - mRNAs, proteins and molecules, electric charge and
light intensity levels. Moreover, also probabilities are positive
quantities, so one should also mention in this list any model such as Hidden 
Markov Models and Phase Type Distributions models.</font></p>
