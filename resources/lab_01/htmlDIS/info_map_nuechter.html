<p>Digital 3D models of the environment are needed in rescue and
inspection robotics, facility managements and architecture. This lecture
presents an automatic system for gaging, digitalization and
interpreting of 3D indoor environments. It consists of a high speed
autonomous/teleoperated mobile robot, a reliable 3D laser range finder and elaborated software modules.</p>

<p>Kurt3D is the fastest indoor robot of the world. It's based on a
mobile robot platform with a size of 45 cm (length) x 33 cm (width) x
26cm (height) and a weight of 15.6 kg. Equipped with the AiS 3D laser
range finder the height increases to 47 cm and weight increases to
22.6 kg. Kurt3D's maximum velocity is 5.2 m/s (autonomously controlled
4.0 m/s. Designing a control program for autonomous mobile robots
means the implementation of a software program, i.e., several cascaded
controllers or behaviors including set value computation. The lecture
presents breifly the control of Kurt3D as well as a novel, laser-based
approach for tracking the pose. Reliable laser tracking in high speed
mobile robotics has to cope with sensor noise, e.g., vibrations.</p>

<p>Mobile robots equipped with a 3D laser range finder are well suited
for gaging 3D data. Elaborated algorithms allow to digitize large
environments fast and reliably without any intervention and solve the
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Robot motion on
natural surfaces has to cope with yaw, pitch and roll angles, turning
pose estimation as well as scan matching or registration into a
problem in six mathematical dimensions, i.e., 6D SLAM. The exploration
of the environment is done by a Next Best View planner that computes
the next nominal pose by maximizing the information gain.</p>
