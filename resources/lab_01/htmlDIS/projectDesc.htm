<h2>Problem studied</h2>

The task of a data integration system is combining the data residing
at different sources, and providing the user with a unified view of
these data, called <em>global schema</em> [Hale01,Lenz02].  Users
query the global schema, while the system carries out the task of
suitably accessing different sources and assembling the data retrieved
at each source into the final answer to the query.

To this aim, the system needs the specification, called
<em>mapping</em>, of the relationship between the sources and the
global schema.  There are two basic approaches to specify such a
mapping [Ullm97,Hale01,Levy00].  The first approach, called
<em>global-as-view</em> (GAV) [GPQR*97], consists of
associating views over the sources to elements of the global
schema, so that the information of the global schema is expressed
in terms of the sources.  The second approach, called
<em>local-as-view</em> (LAV) [LMSS95,DuGL00,MaFK01], consists
of associating views over the global schema to data sources; in
this case, the information content of the sources is defined in
terms of the global schema.

Since the global schema has to represent complex real-world domains,
integrity constraints need to be expressed on it, thus enhancing the
expressiveness of the data integration system.

The main issue related to the presence of integrity constraints is
that data at the sources may not satisfy such constraints.  In such a
situation, a common assumption is to consider the views constituting
the mapping as <em>sound</em>, i.e., it is assumed that the sources
provide (through the mapping) a subset of the data that satisfy the
global schema.

<h2>Our framework</h2>

In this phase of the project, we are addressing query processing in
both GAV and LAV data integration systems in a relational setting, in
the presence of <em>key dependencies</em> (KDs), <em>inclusion
dependencies</em> (IDs), and <em>exclusion dependencies</em> (EDs) on the
global schema, under the assumption of sound views.  The language
adopted for views in the mapping is that of conjunctive queries in the
LAV case, and union of conjunctive queries in the GAV case, while the
language allowed for user queries is that of union of conjunctive
queries.

<a name="os">
<h2>Our solution</h2>

In the above setting, we hace identified decidable classes of
integrity constraints, i.e., classes of key, exclusion and inclusion
dependencies that allow for sound and complete query processing in the
data integration setting defined above. For such classes of
constraints, we have defined effective techniques for query processing
(see the <a href="publications.html">publications related to this
project</a>).

<h2>Project goal</h2>

In this project, we are implementing and experimenting the above
mentioned query processing techniques in a prototype system for data
integration under integrity
constraints. 

The main purpose of the system is to experiment the
effectiveness of our intensional approach to query processing. Indeed,
our aim is not only to arrive at an implementation of a general query
answering mechanism in an expressive data integration setting, but also to
push query processing as much as possible at the intensional level,
following the well-established approaches and technology in standard
database systems. This is a crucial issue especially in data integration
applications, where the real system bottleneck is typically the access to
data sources.

<h2>Our contribution</h2>

Our work is the first to provide a thorough analysis of data
integration (both in the GAV and in the LAV approach) in the
presence of both KDs, IDs and EDs. More specifically, our results
advance the state of the art in data integration in terms of: (i)
decidability results; (ii) new algorithms: our technique is the
first to compute query answering in the presence of both KDs and
cyclic IDs; (iii) a modular treatment of GAV and LAV systems in
the presence of integrity constraints, through the compilation of
LAV into GAV, and of KDs, IDs and EDs, through the separability
property of NKC dependencies; (iv) <em>effective</em> techniques for
data integration (based on such a modularity), which exploit both
off-line and intensional processing of queries: in particular,
although developed for dealing with integrity constraints, our
technique for LAV systems turns out to be simpler than the
well-known technique called <em>inverse rules</em> [DuGL00]
even in the absence of inclusion dependencies.
