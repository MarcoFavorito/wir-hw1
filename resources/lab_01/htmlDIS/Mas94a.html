                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The  goal  of  this
                   paper  is  to  present  a  tableau  calculus  for  propositional  modal
                   logics that is effective for automated proof search, easy to use for
                   proof presentation, and applicable to a wide range of modal logics for knowledge representation. The calculus is also enhanced
                   to provide a form of contextual reasoning to deal with (classical)
                   inconsistency. The basic tableau calculus (Single Step Tableaux)


                   combines the advantage of both sequent-like tableaux and prefixed  tableaux  and  eliminates  the  need  of  complex  closure  operations  for  the  accessibility  relation,  nondeterminism  and  cut
                   rules. Thus analiticy is provided together with a strong completeness theorem without cut. Single Step rules are rather efficient
                   (they satisfy suitable locality principles) and also strongly confluent. They can thus be parallelized and adapted to many search
                   heuristics. The system is then extended to cope with inconsistent
                   belief sets (k-Cluster Tableaux), with a form of local reasoning.<p>
                   Yet it does not requires the introduction of ad hoc connectives,
                   or multiple valued semantics. A simple and intuitive semantics
                   based on Kripke models is presented. Thus, we combine the full
                   power of a modal theorem prover with a system of context handling. It is weak enough to describe knowledge bases where two
                   different consistent statements (modal formulae) may contradict
                   each other (in classical logic), but strong enough to rule out the
                   possibility of an inconsistent statement.<p>
