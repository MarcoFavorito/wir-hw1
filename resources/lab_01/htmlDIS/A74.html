  In this paper we consider two aspects of reasoning about action and change:
  qualification and ramification problems in the context of domain constraint
  axioms. It was pointed out that the same axiom may cause qualification and
  ramification. The reason that we distinguish these two cases lies in the
  semantics of concerning fluents. To distinguish whether a given constrain
  axiom involves qualification or ramification additional information, namely
  "influence relation", which define how fluents can possibly affect each other,
  must be provided. To formalize effects of actions, we use Dijkstra's
  semantics, originally developed for reasoning about programs. In this paper
  we propose a method for solving the qualification and ramification problem
  and show how using the influence relation to distinguish between them.
