In this paper we study a generalization of DATALOG, the language of
function-free definite clauses. It is known that standard DATALOG semantics
(i.e., least Herbrand model semantics) can be obtained by regarding programs
as theories to be circumscribed with all predicates to be minimized. The
extension proposed here, called DATALOG-CIRC, consists in considering the
general form of circumscription, where some predicates are minimized, some
predicates are fixed, and some vary. We study the complexity and the
expressive power of the language thus obtained. We show that this language
(and, actually, its non-recursive fragment) is capable of expressing all the
queries in DB-co-NP and, as such, is much more powerful than standard
DATALOG, whose expressive power is limited to a strict subset of PTIME
queries. Both data and combined complexities of answering DATALOG-CIRC
queries are studied. Data complexity is proved to be co-NP-complete.
Combined complexity is shown to be in general hard for co-NE and complete
for co-NE in the case of Herbrand bases containing k distinct constant
symbols, where k is bounded.
