Belief revision and belief update are two different forms of
belief change, and they serve different purposes.   In this paper
we focus on belief update, the formalization of change in beliefs
due to changes in the world.   The complexity of the basic update
(introduced by Winslett) has been determined by Eiter and
Gottlob.   Since then, many other formalizations have been
proposed to overcome the limitations and drawbacks of Winslett's
update.   In this paper we analyze the complexity of the proposals
presented in the literature:   the standard semantics by Winslett,
the minimal change with exception and the minimal change with
maximal disjunctive information by Zhang and Foo, the update with
disjunctive function by Herzig, the abduction-based update and
the generalized update by Boutilier.   We relate some of these
approaches to belief update to previous work on closed world
reasoning.
