<h1>Reasoning about minimal belief and negation as failure</h1>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p>
We investigate the problem of reasoning in the propositional fragment of
MBNF, the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure introduced by
Lifschitz, which can be considered as a unifying framework for several
nonmonotonic formalisms, including default logic, autoepistemic logic,
circumscription, epistemic queries, and logic programming.  We characterize
the complexity and provide algorithms for reasoning in propositional MBNF.
In particular, we show that entailment in propositional MBNF lies
at the third level of the polynomial hierarchy, hence it is harder than
reasoning in all the above mentioned propositional formalisms for
nonmonotonic reasoning.  We also prove the exact correspondence between
negation as failure in MBNF and negative introspection in Moore's
autoepistemic logic.
