<i>Theoretical Foundations of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</i><p>
Concept languages have been studied in order to give a formal account of the
basic features of frame-based languages. The focus of research in concept
languages was initially on the semantical reconstruction of frame-based
systems and the computational complexity of reasoning. More recently,
attention has been paid to the formalization of other aspects of frame-based
languages, such as non-monotonic reasoning and procedural rules, which are
necessary in order to bring concept languages closer to implemented systems.
In this paper we discuss the above issues in the framework of concept
languages enriched with an epistemic operator. In particular, we show that the



epistemic operator both introduces novel features in the language, such as
sophisticated query formulation and closed world reasoning, and makes it
possible to provide a formal account for some aspects of the existing systems,
such as rules and definitions, that cannot be characterized in a standard
first-order framework.
