<H1> Moving a Robot Starting from a Theory of Actions </H1>


<H2> Abstract </H2>

  The paper describes an approach to reasoning about actions and
  planning that starting from a logical formalization arrives at the
  realization of an actual agent, the mobile robot "Tino". The
  reasoning tools allow the robot to derive plans from the knowledge
  about the environment and the action specification, while its reactive
  capabilities allow it to execute its plans in the real world. The
  formalization is based on the propositional dynamic logics framework,
  but exploits the correspondence that exists between propositional
  dynamic logics and description logics, to carefully weaken the logical
  inference process in order to keep the reasoning tools of the robot
  both effective and efficient.  Such reasoning tools are then
  implemented by making use of a general knowledge representation system
  based on description logics, namely the system CLASSIC.
