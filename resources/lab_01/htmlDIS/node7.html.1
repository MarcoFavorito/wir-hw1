We have studied the problem of assigning fractions of a shared
satellite link's capacity to a set of requests, subject to
feasibility
constraints and so as to maximize the number of admitted requets.  We
propose constant approximation algorithms, based on a linear
programming formulation of the problem and on a sophisticated
rounding
procedure.  We have also considered the problem of on line scheduling
a series of requests on a set of identical machines.  This is a
classical problem in the theory of algorithms.  The goal is
minimizing
end user's perceived latency.  Competitive algorithms are proposed,
both when a user request is completely revealed to the algorithm at
release time and when the processing time of a request is only known
at completion time.  The proposed algorithms asymptotically achieve
the best possible competitive ratios.  Finally, we have addressed the
problem of efficiently routing agents over the Internet by exploiting
approximation algorithms for the TSP and the minimum latency
problem.
