<H2>Abstract </H2>
<P>
We study the complexity of model checking in propositional nonmonotonic
logics.  Specifically, we first define the problem of model checking in
such formalisms, based on the fact that several nonmonotonic logics make
use of interpretation structures (i.e. default extensions, stable
expansions, universal Kripke models) which are more complex than standard
interpretations of propositional logic.  Then, we analyze the complexity of
checking whether a given interpretation structure satisfies a nonmonotonic
theory.  In particular, we characterize the complexity of model checking
for Reiter's default logic and its restrictions, Moore's autoepistemic
logic, and several nonmonotonic modal logics.  The results obtained show
that, in all such formalisms, model checking is computationally easier than
logical inference.</P>
