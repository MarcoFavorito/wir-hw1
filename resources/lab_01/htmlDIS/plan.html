    <H2>Planning and Scheduling</H2>
    Planning is one of the traditional applicative areas in Artificial Intelligence.<p>
Recently the interest in theoretical aspects of planning, such as soundness, completeness and complexity of planners, has grown.  The research related to automated planning and scheduling in Artificial Intelligence has followed various
directions:  tele-communication, management of temporal constraint networks,
and timetabling are the most interesting problem of planning investigated so
far.<p>
    The  development  of  a  specialized  module  to  deal  with  information  about
time in a planning or scheduling architecture has been considered.  Particular
attention has been given to the representation of quantitative information and
to the design of dynamic algorithms that allow to incrementally post and remove
constraint from the network.  A specialization of the AC-3 algorithm for constraint satisfaction has been proposed that allows effective on-line management
of temporal constraints.  Present results are described in <A HREF="CCO94.html">[CCO94]</A>.<p>
    The DRS-Sched system is a knowledge-based scheduling system for planning
the activities of a particular satellite system (the DRS). The system represents
a peculiar set of constraints given by the domain problem and uses specialized
heuristics  to  produce  effective  schedules.  Different  aspects  of  the  system  are
described  in  <A HREF="AC94b.html">[AC94b]</A><A HREF="AC94a.html">[AC94a]</A><A HREF="AC95.html">[AC95]</A>  These  activities  are  supported  by  CNR
Special Project on Automated Planning.<p>
    Communication between agents and the planning of load balancing in a multi
agent environment have also been tackled in <A HREF="SYT95.html">[SYT95]</A> with a particular focus
on learning.  The problem is addressed for systems which can relay neither on
central coordination nor on explicit communication.  Results have been found
on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and the system
efficiency  have  been  produced.   The  properties  of  adaptive  load  balancing  in
heterogeneous populations are also investigated.<p>
    Timetabling is another interesting problem studied in the last years.  It can
be described in terms of a fixed a sequence of meetings between teachers and
students in a prefixed period of time (typically a week), satisfying a set of constraints of various types.  This problem, that has been traditionally considered
in the operational research field, has recently been tackled with techniques belonging also to artificial intelligence (e.g. genetic  algorithms,  tabu  search,  and
simulated annealing).  The paper <A HREF="Sch95a.html">[Sch95a]</A> is a survey of various formulations,
techniques and algorithms used for its solution.<p>
