				This is a more affordable option for small-sized and medium-sized organizations that do not require the advanced scalability, availability, performance, or analysis features of SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition. Standard Edition can be used on symmetric multiprocessing systems with up to 4 CPUs and 2 GB of RAM.
<p>
Standard Edition includes the core functionality needed for non-mission-critical e-commerce, data warehousing, and line-of-business solutions. For instance, all of the XML features present in Enterprise Edition are also included in Standard Edition. And while a handful of advanced OLAP features are reserved for Enterprise Edition, all data mining features and the core OLAP functionality are included in SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services in Standard Edition. Similarly, components that other database vendors charge for as separate add-on products for their highest-end editions are included in Standard Edition: 
<ul>
<li> Data Transformation Services (DTS)
<li> Replication (snapshot, transactional, and merge)
<li> Full-Text Search
<li> English Query
<li> Stored procedure development and debugging tools
<li> SQL Profiling and performance analysis tools
</ul>
