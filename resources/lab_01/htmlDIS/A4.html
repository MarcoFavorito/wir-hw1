  An implication rule Q -> R is roughly a statement of the form for all objects
  in the database, if an object has Q then it has also R. We introduce a
  definition of minimal cover for the set of implication rules that hold in a
  relation, by analogy with earlier work on functional dependencies, and
  present an approach to computing it. The core of the proposed approach is
  an algorithm for inferring a reduced cover containing only maximally general
  rules, i.e., such that no attribute-value pair on any left side is redundant.
  We study the computational complexity of the proposed approach and
  present an experimental comparison with another method that confirms its
  validity, especially when the number of attributes in the database is limited.
