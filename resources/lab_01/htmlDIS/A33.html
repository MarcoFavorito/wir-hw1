  Behaviour protocols are often used to coordinate the action of a group of
  two or more agents by limiting the nature of the agents' goals and the
  possibility of backtracking in the negotiation. The solution presented in this
  paper achieves the maximum flexibility because the negotiation itself is
  object of the planning activity. We extend the reasoning mechanism with
  the introduction of the concept of "knowledge contextualization": each
  context is a set of constraints to the agent action used to describe both
  plans and agreement offers. A working example is presented to illustrate
  these ideas. It shows the simulation of a player of "Diplomacy", a complete
  (and difficult) game of strategy and diplomacy. Finally, we propose a
  backtracking mechanism to solve the contradictions between the constraints
  of different contexts. This mechanism is compared with the Dependency
  Directed Backtracking (DDB) of the TMSs and it is shown that, in our case,
  it is complete while, DDB is not.
