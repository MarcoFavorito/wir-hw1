    <H2>Abduction</H2>
    The primary goal of this research is to characterize abduction as a general
logical formalism by defining proof procedures and semantics methods.<p>
    Logic programming with abductive reasoning can be used (see <A HREF="PP94.html">[PP94]</A>) during the realization of a data dictionary.  In this setting methodological aspects
are represented as a set of rules augmented with integrity constraints which capture the presence of incompatible concepts.  Explanations for incompatibilities
can be inferred by exploiting abductive reasoning. With this aim a new proposal
for hypotheses computation in a general logic program is presented.  It is based
on a suitable manipulation of minimal three-valued models of logic programs.<p>
A method to compute three-valued minimal models of a general logic program
is also given.<p>
    In  <A HREF="CMP95.html">[CMP95]</A>  the  problem  of  performing  abduction  in  modal  logics  is  addressed.  The non-classical context points out the value of analytical proof systems as tools to face the meta-logical and proof-theoretical aspects involved in
abductive reasoning.  The similarities and differences between quantifiers and
modal operators are investigated and proof theoretical abduction methods for
the modal systems K, D, T and S4, that are sound and complete, are defined.<p>
