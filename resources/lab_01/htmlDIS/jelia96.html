<H1> A Uniform Tableaux Method for Nonmonotonic Modal Logics </H1>

<H2> Abstract </H2>

We present a semantic tableaux calculus for propositional nonmonotonic
modal logics, based on possible-worlds characterizations for nonmonotonic
modal logics. This method is parametric with respect to both the modal
logic and the preference semantics, since it handles in a uniform way the
entailment problem for a wide class of nonmonotonic modal logics: McDermott
and Doyle's logics and ground logics. It also achieves the computational
complexity lower bounds.
