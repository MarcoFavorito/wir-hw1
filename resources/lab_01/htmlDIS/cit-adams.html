<p> ... on Hawalius: a planet of oracles and seers and soothsayers
and also take-away pizza shops ...
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The village of oracles wasn't much better.
<br>
He had been told that when looking for a good oracle it was best to find the
oracle that other oracles went to, but he was shut.
<br>
[...]
Next door was a cave a few hundred yards away and Arthur walked towards it.
<br>
[...]
There was also a very nasty smell coming from the pot. At least, Arthur thought
it was coming from the pot. The distendes bladdersof some of the local
goat-like things were hanging from a propped-up line drying in the sun, and the
smell could have been coming from them. There was also, a worryingly small 
distance  away, a pile of discarded bodies of the local
goat-like things and the smell could have been coming from them.
<br>
But the smell could have just as easily have been coming from the old lady who
was busy beating flies away from the pile of bodies. It was a hopeless task
because each of the flies was about the size of a wingled bottle top and all
she had was a table tennis bat. Also she seemed half blind. Every now and then,
by chance, her wild trashing would connect with one of the flies with a richly
satisfying thunk, and the fly would hurtle through the air and smack itself
open against the rock face a few yards from the entrance to her cave.
<br>
She gave the impression, by her demeanour, that these were the moments she
lived for.
<br>
Arthur watched this exotic performance for a while from a polite distance, and
then at last tried giving a gentle cough to attract her attention. The gentle
cough, courteously meant, unfortunately involved first inhaling rather more of
the local atmosphere than he had so far being doing and as a result, he erupted
into a fit of raucous expectoration, and collapsed against the rock face,
choking and streaming with tears. He struggled for breath, but each new breath
made things worse. He vomited, half-choked again, rolled over his vomit, kept
rolling for a few yards, and eventually made it up on to his hands and knees
and crawled, panting, into slightly fresher air.
