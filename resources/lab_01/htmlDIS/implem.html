<P>
Vision systems for mobile robots involve image processing
and interpretation, in order to reconstruct the world seen from
the camera or for object recognition.<BR>

Image processing require a representation of the image in RAM
memory, so it requires digitizing the analog NTSC or PAL signal
coming from the camera and transfering the image to the RAM.

<P>
To this end a set of hardware and software components are required:
<OL>
<LI>Video Camera
<LI>Frame grabber (digitization device)
<LI>Device Drivers (OS driver for FG management)
<LI>Image acquisition library (high-level functions for image acquisition)
<LI>Image processing tools
</OL>

<P>&nbsp</P>

<P>
I had some experience with both Matrox Meteor and BT848-based frame grabbers.
I found both of them suitable for image processing applications.
Moreover, some BT848-based FG is very cheap.

<P>
As for the OS, I am very happy working with my Linux system.
It is not difficult, and very interesting, to write a device driver
for Linux.

<P>
There at least two different BT848 drivers for Linux, but I consider
<A HREF="http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~iocchi/bt848/">bt848 driver</A>
to be more appropriate for image processing.

<P>
Image acquisition libraries are usually included in the driver package.

<P>
Many image processing tools are available (see for example 
<A HREF="http://www.khoral.com/">Khoros</A>).
