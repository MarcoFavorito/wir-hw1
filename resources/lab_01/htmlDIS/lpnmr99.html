<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>We investigate the problem of reasoning in nonmonotonic extensions of
first-order logic.  In particular, we study reasoning in first-order
MKNF, the modal logic of minimal knowledge and negation as failure
introduced by Lifschitz.  MKNF can be considered as a unifying framework
for several nonmonotonic formalisms, including default logic, autoepistemic
logic, circumscription, and logic programming.  By suitably extending
deduction methods for propositional nonmonotonic logics, we define
techniques for reasoning in significant subsets of first-order MKNF,
which allow for characterizing decidable fragments of first-order
nonmonotonic modal logics.  Due to the expressive abilities of MKNF,
such techniques can be seen as general reasoning methods for several
nonmonotonic formalisms based on first-order logic.  We also analyze the
relationship between such decidable fragments of MKNF and disjunctive
Datalog.
