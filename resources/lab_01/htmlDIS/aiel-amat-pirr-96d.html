In this paper we propose intuitionistic logic as the minimal logic most suitable
to define autoepistemic logic. We start from a formal analysis of the notion of
consistency on an intuitionistic basis, via Gentzen's sequent calculus. Then we
show that the epistemic operator M interpreted as a consistency operator
behaves coherently and is also an adequate interpretation of the intuitionistic
consistency notion. Intuitionistic stable sets are introduced and given a
semantics, on the basis of a bimodal structure, which is shown to be sound
and complete. The results of the work are related to Gabbay's ~-models. The
relation between our formalization and other works on autoepistemic logic is
also investigated.
