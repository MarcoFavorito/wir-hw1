<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
<br>
We describe a general technique for converting an online
algorithm  to a truthtelling mechanism. We require that the original
online competitive algorithm has certain ``niceness'' properties in
that actions on future requests are independent of the actual value of
requests which were accepted (though these actions will of course
depend upon the set of accepted requests). Under these conditions, we
are able to give an online truth telling mechanism (where the values
of requests are given by bids which may not accurately represent the
valuation of the requesters) such that our total profit is within
logarithmic factor of the optimum offline profit obtained by an
omniscient algorithm (one which knows the true valuations of the
users<p>
 
In general there is an logarithmic  lower bound on the ratio of
worst-case profit for a truth telling mechanism when compared to the
profit obtained by an omniscient algorithm, so this result is in some
sense best possible. In addition, we prove that our construction is
resilient against many forms of ``cheating'' attempts, such as forming
coalitions.
