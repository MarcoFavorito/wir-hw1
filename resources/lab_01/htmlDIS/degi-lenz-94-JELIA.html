One of the main themes in the area of Terminological Reasoning has been to
identify description logics (DLs) that are both very properties of classes in
terms of binary relations, and establishing several interdependencies among
classes. One of the main themes in the area of DLs has been to identify DLs
that are both very expressive and decidable. This issue can be profitably
addressed by relying on a correspondence between DLs and propositional
dynamic logics (PDLs). In this paper, we exploit the correspondence as a
framework to investigate the decidability and the complexity of a powerful DL,
in which functional restrictions on both atomic roles and their inverse are
expressible. We then show that such DL is suitable to represent n-ary
relations, as needed in the applications of class-based formalisms to databases.
The PDL that we use in this work is a proper extension of Converse
Deterministic PDL, and its decidability and complexity is established
contextually.
