<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>InfoPath 2003, the new information-gathering program 
of the Microsoft Office System of products, makes it easier to collect 
information and reuse it throughout an organization. Companies today typically 
collect and use massive amounts of information in forms, spreadsheets, or 
e-mail. But because the data is trapped within documents or databases scattered 
throughout the organization, key decision makers often don't have the correct 
data to make the most informed decisions. InfoPath helps address these problems.
