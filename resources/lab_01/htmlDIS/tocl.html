<h1>Description Logics of Minimal Knowledge and Negation as Failure</h1>

<H2>Abstract </H2>

<p>
We present Description Logics of minimal knowledge and negation as
failure (MKNF-DLs), which augment Description Logics with modal operators
interpreted according to Lifschitz's nonmonotonic logic MKNF.  We show the
usefulness of MKNF-DLs for a formal characterization of a wide variety of
nonmonotonic features, that are both commonly available in frame-based
systems, and needed in the development of practical knowledge-based
applications: defaults, integrity constraints, role and concept closure.
In addition, we provide a correct and terminating calculus for query
answering in a very expressive MKNF-DL.
