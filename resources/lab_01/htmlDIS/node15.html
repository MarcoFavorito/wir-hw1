We shall work in three important general areas of algorithm design,
namely on-line/dynamic algorithms, optimisation/approximation
algorithms and string algorithms.  The need for dynamic and on-line
algorithms arises in problems which vary over time and in which large
streams of requests (updates, queries) must be processed rapidly. We
plan to tackle the new challenges of this area, such as the design of
dynamic algorithms for max flow and reachability problems, the average
case analysis of dynamic algorithms, and lower bounds for dynamic
graphs. We shall also develop on-line algorithms for network problems,
such as on-line routing and call admission, as well as scheduling and
planning problems.  Furthermore, we shall consider specific logistics
problems relevant in our industrial collaborations. We shall also
explore the use of randomisation and parallelism to obtain more
competitive solutions.
<P>
In some hard optimisation problems that must be solved in practice,
one often looks for approximate solutions with a small distance from
optimality. The branch-and-cut technique, which combines polyhedral
combinatorics with efficient separation algorithms, appears to be the
most promising recent line of attack in this important area (many
practical instances of the traveling salesman problem of a few hundred
nodes can be solved to optimality, and instances with a few thousand
nodes to within, say, 1% of optimality in reasonable time). We want
to apply this novel technique to combinatorial optimisation problems
that play an important role in applications. In particular, we plan to
investigate the determination of maximum planar subgraphs under side
conditions, relevant in automated graph drawing, and the maximum cut
problem, relevant in circuit layout design and statistical physics. We
shall also apply other approximation techniques to other difficult
optimisation problems, such as graph bisection, which have 
applications
in high-performance computer networks, computer-integrated
manufacturing environments, and graph drawing. Furthermore, we shall
study the class APX of NP-complete optimisation problems that allow
approximation algorithms within a constant ratio of optimality, and
search for efficient parallel approximation algorithms for P-complete
problems.  An important technique that we shall pursue is the use of
random walks on Markov chains defined by combinatorial problems. This
enables approximate counting and almost uniform generation, and yields
approximate randomised solutions to several important problems.

In many applications, such as lexicography and computational biology,
there is an urgent need for new techniques and data structures for the
retrieval of textual information from huge data bases. We shall
address basic problems common to many applications, such as
pattern-matching and string-alignment: searching a large set of
strings to find all occurrences of substrings that are ``similar'' to 
a
given pattern, and determining similarities among strings under a
distance measure which may reflect mutations, experimental error or
``noise''. We analyse periodicity structures in strings and trees (an
essential aspect for efficient searching algorithms), and exploit the
powerful technique of hash functions for string processing.
Applications will be made to computational biology, where we shall
develop algorithms for protein identification through mass
fingerprinting and approximate algorithms for the construction of
phylogenetic trees.  Some of this work will be implemented in a
library of efficient string algorithms and exploited for computational
biochemistry.
