      <P><h2>Introduction</h2>


      <P>The Artificial Intelligence research group is mainly working in Knowledge
      Representation, Planning, Search and Natural language processing.
      Knowledge Representation gathers those subfields of AI investigating the
      underlying principles of reasoning like logical foundations, languages and
      complexity of reasoning. Researcheres working in Knowledge Representation
      are mainly concerned with the following topics: <OL>
      <LI>  Developing suitable formalisms to support various aspects of reasoning,
            which in the following pages are collected under the title "Commonsense
            reasoning";

      <LI>  Specifying formal languages for knowledge representation, which
            integrate different logics and formalisms, though maintaining nice
            computational properties. These topics are illustrated in the section on
            "Description logics";

      <LI>  Investigating languages for programs, actions, intentions and in general
            languages to represent dynamic changes. Researcesh done on these
            languages are described in the sections titled "Modal and dynamic
            logics" and "Reasoning about actions";

<LI>  Studying computational properties of formalisms and languages, and other
      usually adopted reasoning tools. These topics are illustrated in the section
      "Complexity of Reasoning". </OL> In particular, research on description
      logics, actions, commonsense reasoning and complexity led to the realization of
      tools and techniques that support the specification and implementation of
      software for controlling the mobile robot Tino.
      <P>The international recognition of the achievements in the field of knowledge
      representation, is highlighted by the choice of Prof. Luigia Carlucci Aiello as
      program co-chair of the fifth international conference on the principles of
      knowledge representation and reasoning (KR-96) <A HREF="/~ai/citations/aiel-etal-96.html">[CADS96]</A>.
      <P>Research in other areas of AI, like planning, scheduling and natural
      language processing has been quite active in developing tools for applications
      to real cases and prototypes.
      <P>The planning research group has devised algorithms, heuristics and suitable
      formalisms to realize flexible architectures for planning and scheduling, the
      work is described in the section on "Knowledge-based architectures for
      planning and scheduling".
      <P>The work on search is described in the section on "Constraint reasoning
      and scheduling"; it proposes a new approach to search, by extending
      constraint programming techniques.
      <P>Finally, the group working on"Natural language" has been developing a
      prototype combining natural language and hypertextual descriptions.

<h2>Commonsense Reasoning</h2>


<P>Commonsense reasoning investigates the reasoning mechanisms of an agent
interacting with the real world in which it often has to take the troublesome
decision of completing or withdrawing information in order to be coherent
with its observations and undertake suitable actions. Classical formalisms such
as first-order logics are, in general, inadequate to deal with the complex
reasoning task required by a human-level intelligent agent behaving, with
commonsense, in the real world. Therefore different forms of reasoning, such
as nonmonotonic reasoning, belief revision, abduction, contextual reasoning
etc., have been devised in the knowledge representation research community to
challenge limitations of classical formalisms with new forms of reasoning
mechanisms. The above research areas are, indeed, those investigated by the
research group working on commonsense reasoning and new results are
described in the following subsections.

<h3>Nonmonotonic Reasoning</h3>

<P>The central problem of nonmonotonic reasoning is now that of providing an
adequate notion of nonmonotonic provability together with a methodology for
nonmonotonic inference and studying its computational properties. This
approach to nonmonotonic reasoning provides both proof-theoretical and
mechanical strategies to treat agent reasoning and the logical basis to admit
for a unified view of the different formalisms proposed.
<P>It turns out that logics able to embed nonmonotonic inference are modal
logics that allow for a context dependent form of reasoning requiring, in its
turn, context dependent proofs. In fact, the natural way to express the meta
logical concepts involved in nonmonotonic inference like "it is provable" or "it
is consistent to assume" is to turn to modal operators.
<P>Most of the works from our nonmonotonic reasoning group deal with the
family of modal logics into which nonmonotonic formalisms are embeddable,
namely <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96J4.html">[ACP96a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96x.html">[ACP96b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96W1.html">[ACP96b]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-pirr-96P2.html">[AP96]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/aiello-96.html">[Car96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-aiel-pirr-96.html">[ACP96a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR96.html">[DNR97]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/DMNR-96.html">[DMNR96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa96b.html">[Ros97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa96c.html">[Ros96]</A>, together
with a study on the expressiveness of some of such modal logics and in general
on the methodologies for nonmonotonic inference, in particular addressed in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96c.html">[ACGP96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/DMNR-96.html">[DMNR96]</A>.



<h4>Ground Logics</h4>

<P>The study of ground nonmonotonic modal logics, a variant of
nonmonotonic modal logics due to McDermott and Doyle (MDD), has been
carried out in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR96.html">[DNR97]</A>. First, a possible-world semantics for
ground logics is presented, which both generalizes the notion of minimal
knowledge and provides a semantic characterization for this class of modal
formalisms. Then, the computational properties of ground logics are analyzed.
A major result is that reasoning in the ground logic for the modal system S5
can be placed at the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. It is also proven
that this is a lower bound for reasoning in all ground logics, and an upper
bound for most of such formalisms. Finally, several representational features of
ground logics are discussed, in particular defaults and forward rules, and a
thorough comparison with McDermott and Doyle's logics is provided.
<P>The relationship between minimal knowledge and (MDD) nonmonotonic
modal logics is studied in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa96b.html">[Ros97]</A>. In particular, it is shown that
(1) the logic of minimal knowledge states due to Halpern and Moses can be
expressed in most of the modal formalisms of the MDD family, and (2) the
existence of cases in which minimal knowledge states and preferred models in
MDD logics coincide. These results imply that, in a large subset of MDD
logics, modalities can be given a minimal knowledge interpretation, as far as
they are not nested modalities. Thus, the higher degree of complexity of
reasoning with minimal knowledge cannot be attributed to the interpretation
of the modal operator in this logic.
<P>A computational characterization of the propositional fragment of MBNF,
the bimodal logic of minimal belief and negation as failure introduced by
Lifschitz, is presented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa96c.html">[Ros96]</A>. In particular, it is shown that
the problem of reasoning in the propositional fragment of MBNF lies at the
third level of the polynomial hierarchy, whereas reasoning with MBNF theories
without nested occurrences of the modalities lies at the second level of the
polynomial hierarchy. This last result implies that, under the stable model
semantics, lifting the syntax of the logic program to rules allowing
propositional formulas as goals, does not affect the worst-case complexity of
deduction for disjunctive programs with negation as failure.
<h4>Provability Logics</h4>

<P>One of the central issues in nonmonotonic logic is to establish a notion of
nonmonotonic provability, which is usually characterized via some modal logic
together with a suitable construction. The central result presented in the
papers <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96J4.html">[ACP96a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96x.html">[ACP96b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96W1.html">[ACP96b]</A> is the identification of a modal logic,
KD4Z, which can be understood as the logic of nonmonotonic provability. In
fact in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96W1.html">[ACP96b]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96J4.html">[ACP96a]</A> a
fixed point construction is presented, which allows for the interpretation of the



necessity modal operator as a nonmonotonic provability operator analogously
to that used in the modal logic of provability for Peano Arithmetic. The logic
proposed is a fixed point logic that can be extended to first order modal logic,
under some limitations. By means of the fixed point results many
nonmonotonic formalisms can be expressed at the language level, that is,
without any further meta-logical construction, besides the modal operators.
Furthermore the way nonmonotonic assertions can be translated into such a
logic allows for many forms of contextual reasoning. Therefore also contextual
definitions of concepts, which discussed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-carl-pirr-96J4.html">[ACP96a]</A>,
can be resolved with the proposed translation. Fixed point equations provide,
in fact, a generalization, which correctly captures the relativized context, of
explicit definitions of natural kinds, that is, concepts like lemon or chair,
which, without referring to a suitable context, would not be explicitly
definable.
<P>On the other side, in the light of this new logic of provability, the paradigm
proposed by Marek and Truscszynski that classifies modal monotonic logics,
augmented with the "negation by failure" to prove rule, turns out not to be
complete. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-pirr-96P2.html">[AP96]</A> different paradigms for formalizing
the notion of nonmonotonic provability is presented. It is shown that it
faithfully interprets both default and autoepistemic logics and its connections
with the standard fixed point constructiona`la McDermott and Doyle are
highlighted. This new paradigm provides a different perspective in the
classification of modal nonmonotonic logics.
<h4>Automated Deduction in NMR</h4>

<P>A uniform deduction method for nonmonotonic modal logics is presented in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/DMNR-96.html">[DMNR96]</A>. More precisely, a semantic tableaux calculus based
on possible-worlds characterizations for nonmonotonic modal logics is defined.
The method is in principle able to handle the entailment problem for a wide
class of nonmonotonic modal logics characterized by a preference semantics on
Kripke models, therefore it can be seen as a very general reasoning method for
nonmonotonic modal formalisms. In particular, the calculus is analyzed for
both (MDD)'s logics and ground logics, showing that such a method achieves
the computational complexity lower bounds in these cases.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96c.html">[ACGP96]</A> tableaux for all the default logics
proposed, namely Reiter's, Lukaszewics' and Brewka's default logics, are
presented. Moreover a default methodology within the framework of the
general theory of logical systems is presented. Such a default methodology
amounts to the following: given a logical system such as classical logic,
intuitionistic logic, modal logic etc. the tableaux system presented is able to
capture any of the above mentioned default formalisms in such a logical
system. Therefore a meaning to the notion of a default methodology suitable
for that system is given. The paper identifies the basic notions and
constructions involved and studies their nature.



<h3>Belief Revision</h3>

<P>Belief Revision is an area of commonsense reasoning involving the problem
of changing a knowledge base as a result of a contradictory observation. A
specific computational aspect of belief revision is the size of the propositional
formula obtained by revising a formula with another new formula. The paper
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-96-d.html">[CDLS96]</A> focuses on the size of the smallest formula
equivalent to the revised knowledge base. Its main result is that not all
formalizations of belief revision are equivalent from this point of view. For
some of them the revised knowledge base can be expressed with a formula
admitting a polynomial-space representation but for others the revised
knowledge base does not always admit a polynomial-space representation:
formalisms with the same complexity may have different compactability
properties.
<P>The paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97.html">[Lib97]</A> contains an analysis of the complexity of
revising a knowledge base when an iteration of this process is necessary. The
analysis concerns both the classical problems of belief revision (inference,
model checking, computation of the new base) and new issues, related to the
problem of "committing" the changes.
<P>In the paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-scha-96.html">[LS96]</A> the computational complexity of the
problem of deciding if an interpretation is a model of a revised knowledge base
is studied. One of the main result of this research is that the above problem is
often, but not always, related to the other important problem of belief
revision, namely deciding if a formula is implied by a revised base.
<P>Belief update is a different form of belief change. Revision and update
serve different purposes. In the last few years, more attention has been paid to
belief update, and many formalizations have been introduced.
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97-c.html">[Lib97]</A> reports the results of the analysis of the complexity of
the proposals presented in the literature are reported. Some of those proposals
have also been related to previous work on closed world reasoning.

<h3>Abduction</h3>

<P>Abduction is a natural form of reasoning in any scientific field where new
knowledge may be gained by observation of real world facts. It is also a
common form of everyday reasoning and its formalization has recently
attracted much attention in the AI community. In fact, abduction plays an
important role in intelligent problem solving tasks such as diagnosis, natural
language interpretation, plan recognition and many others aspects yet not
deeply investigated, like program debugging.
<P>Abductive reasoning takes place when new evidence informs an agent's
knowledge and it consists in inferring the truth of a sentence, from the fact
that it would explain the new evidence. In general there may be different
sentences explaining the same evidence, so alternative ones have to be rejected
before the inference is performed. In other terms the inference is drawn when



the agent is convinced that any other sentence is not plausible enough,
compared with the chosen one, to be accepted as an explanation. However, the
logical nature of abduction is still far from being clear and different
specifications of the key underlying concepts have been given, that make it
difficult to speak of abduction as a single well-defined form of reasoning. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cial-pirr-96.html">[CP96]</A> a preliminary discussion on the logical nature of
abductive reasoning, emphasizing the fundamental difference between
abductive and deductive inference, is given. Some logical properties of the
inference to the "best explanation" are put forward and analyzed when the
underlying logic is any extension of classical propositional logic (first order
logic, modal logic) or a non monotonic system.
<P>The paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cial-pirr-96P1.html">[CP96]</A>, offers an insight into the logical
structure of classical abduction, as far as the characterization of a suitable
notion of preference is concerned. In the classical view the notion of abductive
explanation is characterized - modulo some generalization - as follows. Given
a knowledge base K (also called background knowledge), a consequence
relation, and a statement expressing the new evidence E to be explained, an
abduction problem arises when K does not entail E. A statement H is taken as
a "good explanation" of the new evidence E, with respect to the knowledge
base K iff H, together with K, entails E. The statement H is "liked better"
than any other statement in the set of all possible explanations, i.e. statements
that together with the knowledge base entail the new evidence, according to a
given preference criterium. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cial-pirr-96P1.html">[CP96]</A> it is shown that the
above notion can be expressed at the logical level by modeling, through nested
Kripke structures, both suitable preference relations on formulae and the
choice of a best explanation according to the established preference criteria.

<h3>Entrenchment Relations</h3>

<P>Since nonmonotonic reasoning through modal logic is done entirely on
modalized formulas, using the modal logic proof theory, it is not appropriate
for many contexts where one would like to represent knowledge bases using
objective formulas. This is especially important when one uses directly a
database for reasoning (deductive database). Therefore one would like to have
a non-modal formalism capable of generating nonmonotonic reasoning. One
proposal of this kind is G"ardenfors and Makinson's epistemic entrenchment for
the AGM belief revision postulates. Entrenchment is an ordering of formulas
based on preference. As belief revision closely relates to nonmonotonic
reasoning, one can define nonmonotonic inference using epistemic
entrenchment. The first outcome of our research on entrenchment is a
comparative study of the best behaved nonmonotonic formalisms: Lehmann
and Magidor's rational inference and G"ardenfors and Makinson's expectation
inference. We showed that these two classes of inference relations are basically
the same since both employ a linear entrenchment on formulas. This result
appears in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/georg-jelia-96.html">[Geo96]</A>.



<P>Since rational inference is characterized by a linear ordering of formulas, a
natural question arises, namely, what kind of inference is based on partial
orderings. This question (and a similar one in belief revision) remained open
since G"ardenfors and Makinson's classical paper on epistemic entrenchment.
This question was answered by showing that preferential inference, that is, the
minimal inference defined on Shoham's preferential models, is generated by a
partial ordering on sentences. Moreover, it can be shown that all
nonmonotonic inference is generated by a class of relations, called
entrenchment relations, containing the above mentioned partial orderings.
These results appear in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/georg-rep-96.html">[Geo96b]</A> and
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/georg-apal-97.html">[Geo96a]</A>.
<P>The above representation offers an alternative to default or conditional
information as a basis for inference from a knowledge base. We currently try
to explore the meaning of entrenchment relations. A first proposal that
generates such orderings from user's preferences enables us to perform
information retrieval (<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-georg-96.html">[AG96]</A>). More connections with
Logic Programming, Probability Theory, Statistical Analysis and Machine
Learning are currently sought.

<h3>Contextual Reasoning</h3>

<P>Among the various formalisms developed to deal with contextual reasoning,
McCarthy has proposed the logic of context with the ist (c; p) modality as
foundational formalism. The development of automated deduction methods
for this logic has been carried in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96.html">[Mas96b]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96-b.html">[Mas96a]</A>. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96.html">[Mas96b]</A> a
tableaux method for the propositional logic of contexts has been proposed and
its complexity analyzed. This proof method shows also that logic of contexts is
in NP rather than in PSPACE as it is the case with competing formalism such
as modal logics or Multi-Language hierarchical logics.
<P>Still, contextual reasoning is infeasible in practice and therefore a new
deduction method, based on approximate but tractable reasoning has been
developed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96-b.html">[Mas96a]</A>. This work combines a traditional
tableaux method with the use of a vocabulary of relevant sentences to
approximate the search and construct an anytime algorithm. Different
construction of a vocabulary may be used to model the needs of the knowledge
engineer. A formal semantics for approximation is developed.
<P>The need of an explicit modeling for the usage of reasoning resources by an
intelligent agent is tackled in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/weyh-cado-talc-97.html">[WCT97]</A>. In particular,
notions such as problems, solutions, and problem solving activities _which are
usually left implicit in the discussions of autonomous agents_ are explicitly
described and a framework to reason about them is provided. This work
describes the architecture of a reasoner, which solves puzzles (built from a
finite number of components) and reasons about knowledge, by explicitly using
the notion of resource.



<h2>Description Logics</h2>


<P>The goal of this research is to study the foundations of a logical approach
to structured knowledge representation languages, with regard to both the
expressive power and the computational properties of the associated reasoning
techniques. The definition of knowledge bases by means of structured
knowledge representation languages is done by specifying a terminological
knowledge base (TBox), where concepts are defined, along with an assertional
knowledge base (ABox), where facts about individuals are stated in terms of
these concepts.
<P>A survey on reasoning techniques for description logics has been published
as <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DLNS-96.html">[DLNS96]</A>. Reasoning is considered in four settings:
subsumption between concept expressions, instance checking wrt an ABox
(including the use of an epistemic operator), subsumption wrt a TBox, and
subsumption and instance checking in the most general setting (ABox and
TBox).
<P>A detailed in depth treatment of schema level reasoning for a rich class of
schema definition languages is presented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-96.html">[Cal96]</A>. The languages
which are expressed in the style of Description Logics are devised in an
incremental manner, starting from the basic features present in practically all
representation formalisms, and considering the addition of various constructs
of practical relevance. Lower bounds for reasoning with respect to several
interesting types of schemata are shown, and sound and complete reasoning
procedures are presented. Reasoning is analyzed separately for the
unrestricted case, i.e. when considering arbitrary, possibly infinite models, and
for the finite case, i.e. when only finite models are taken into account. In both
cases tight complexity bounds are established. The high expressivity of the
studied languages, allows one to model several representation formalism used
both in Knowledge Representation and databases. Therefore, the developed
reasoning procedures can immediately be exploited in the different contexts.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-96-d.html">[Cal96a]</A> techniques for reasoning in very expressive
Description Logics are studied. In such logics the finite model property fails
and finiteness of the interpretation domain has to be taken into account. It is
shown that a restricted form of finiteness can be captured, while still
exploiting the powerful techniques for reasoning with respect to arbitrary
models. The main result is a sound and complete algorithm to reason with
respect to finite models in the presence of inverse roles, cardinality constraints,
and arbitrary inclusions between concepts. Such combination of constructs,
which had not been dealt with before, provides the necessary expressivity to
go beyond most semantic and object-oriented database models, and capture
several useful extensions.
<P>As shown in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-96.html">[CDGL96]</A>, the expressivity of this logic
allows one to represent Document Type Definitions (DTDs) expressed in the
Standard Generalized Markup Language. To this end the possibility to express



transitive closure and to impose finite nesting on structures is fundamental.
The proposed formalization provides a method for verifying various forms of
equivalence of DTDs, which works in worst case deterministic exponential
time, in contrast to the known algorithms for this problem which are double
exponential. The reasoning services studied in this paper can be seen as the
fundamental building blocks for devising more complex inference systems
supporting the task of querying the World Wide Web. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/barc-etal-96.html">[BILN96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-etal-96.html">[CDIetal96]</A> an architecture for a
knowledge-based system to access information on the Web is presented. The
system is based on the use of description logics to represent content, syntax
and links of Web pages and on a planning component to answer user queries.
<P>The complexity of schema level reasoning for less expressive Description
logics is analyzed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-96-c.html">[Cal96b]</A>. While the computational
complexity of reasoning on pure concept expressions has been characterized
completely for all relevant Description Logics, reasoning in the presence of
schema axioms is not so well understood and far from being settled
completely. An important class of schemata is that of primitive schemata (in
which the schema axioms express only necessary conditions) possibly
containing cycles. This paper provides, for a relevant class of description
logics, a complete characterization of computational complexity of reasoning in
these types of schemata, both in the presence and in the absence of cycles.
The results are obtained by devising reasoning procedures that can deal with
disjunction, showing PSPACE-hardness of concept consistency already for the
simplest language, and introducing a general technique by which the
constructor for existential quantification can be removed without influencing
the result of reasoning.
<P>Research on description logics has systematically investigated concept
satisfiability and concept subsumption for a wide range of constructs. In the
past years an analogue study has been carried out by our group taking into
account TBoxes of the most general form (no restrictions on cycles). It has
systematically investigated satisfiability and subsumption wrt TBoxes for a
wide range of constructs, with emphasis on extending the set of constructs,
thus studying the edge of decidability, instead of the edge of tractability. This
is because even for very simple description logics, reasoning tasks that take
into account TBoxes are already EXPTIME-hard. The techniques adopted for
such investigations are based on the correspondence between description logics
and propositional dynamic logics. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lenz-KR-96.html">[DGL96]</A> it is
studied the integration of extensional knowledge on single objects (ABox) and
intensional knowledge on classes/concepts (TBox) in expressive description
logics. In particular it is established decidability and characterized the
computational complexity of inference, by devising a polynomial encoding of
ABoxes into TBoxes that is sound and complete wrt inference.
<P>A notable application of expressive description logics is providing formal
semantics and reasoning services to conceptual data models. In



<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-nagg-96.html">[DGN96]</A> a conceptual data model is defined that allows for
a rich spectrum of statistical aggregations of data. A fundamental feature of
such a model is the possibility of building statistical aggregates not only from
elementary data but also from complex data that are in turn obtained by
statistical aggregation.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lenz-JAIR-97.html">[DGL97]</A> a special description logic is developed
that allows for the coexistence, in the same TBox, of recursive/cyclic
assertions (or definitions) interpreted according to the different semantics
proposed in literature. The different semantics have a complementary role.
For example inductive definitions of concepts are captured by the
Least-Fixpoint Semantics, while coinductive definitions are captured by the
Greatest-Fixpoint Semantics, finally the Descriptive Semantics is the only one
able to assign meaning to general inclusion assertions. The proposed
description logic, an extension of ALC   called Mu-ALCQ, captures the various
intended meanings by allowing in the language explicit fixpoint-constructs.
Besides the fixpoint constructs, Mu-ALCQ is equipped with "qualified number
restrictions" to express very general cardinality constraint on links. In the
paper the EXPTIME-decidability of the logic is proved by exposing a tight
correspondence with a logic of programs (extension of propositional dynamic
logic), called modal mu-calculus, used to reason about temporal properties of
concurrent processes.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DLNSN-96.html">[DLNetal96]</A> the addition of an epistemic operator to
description logics is studied in detail. A complete calculus for answering
epistemic queries to a non-modal ABox is devised, and the calculus is
optimized to meet the computational resources corresponding to the
complexity of the problem. Extensive examples showing the usefulness of an
epistemic description logics are provided, including a formalization of
procedural rules in real systems is shown.
<P>Intensional query answering is the process of generating answers to
knowledge bases by exploiting intensional knowledge in contrast to the
extensional one. The resulting answers, called intensional answers, are used to
characterize in a compact way the set of data which satisfy a query
("extensional answer"), emphasizing "why" certain data do answer the query
instead of listing all such data. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-JIIS-96.html">[DG96b]</A> the problem of
generating intensional answers is analyzed in the case the knowledge base is
expressed as a general logic program (allowing for negation within the body of
the clauses), devising an effective technique to generate intensional answers
based on the Partial Evaluation of the query in the program.

<h2>Modal and Dynamic Logics</h2>


<P>This research activity has focussed on the development of effective
deductions methods for dynamic and modal logics which have a number of
important applications in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Security



<P>A first step is <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-96.html">[DG96a]</A> where the "converse" operator from the
Converse Propositional Dynamic Logic (CPDL) is eliminated by a polynomial
encoding of CPDL formulae into basic propositional dynamic logic (PDL). The
encoding eliminates converse programs but preserves both satisfiability and
validity. Thus one can perform inference in CPDL, by encoding CPDL
formulae into PDL, and then running an inference procedure for PDL, which
are simpler to devise and implement in practice.
<P>A further advance since the work of Pratt in 1982 has been the development
of tableaux method and algorithms directly for CPDL. Developing further the
work of <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96-d.html">[Mas96]</A>, a prefixed tableaux calculus for CPDL is
devised in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-mass-96.html">[DGM96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-mass-96-b.html">[DGM96]</A>, based on
a combination of different techniques such as prefixed tableaux for modal
logics and model checkers for mu-calculus. The calculus, which is naively
worst-case NEXPTIME, is transformed into an EXPTIME algorithm (recall
that CPDL is EXPTIME-complete) but using careful techniques which makes
full use also of failed computations.
<P>The development of tableaux method for access control and computer
security has been tackled in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97.html">[Mas97b]</A>. This work presents a
prefixed tableaux method for the calculus developed at the Digital System
Resource Centre by Abadi, Lampson et. al. for the formal verification of
authentication and access controls systems. Beside the applicative interest the
calculus poses interesting technical challenges, since it has not the tree-model
property, introduces relations between modalities which cannot be compiled
into axiom schemata, and has some features of the universal modality.
<P>This approach has been extended to the new security formalism based on
Role-Based access control in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-b.html">[Mas97a]</A> and to security protocols
in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-c.html">[Mas97a]</A>.
<P>A further improvement has been achieved in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-d.html">[Mas97b]</A> with
the introduction of the operation of simplification which plays for tableaux the
same role of subsumption for resolution and unit for Davis-Putnam. Beside its
computational effectiveness, the simplicity and generality of simplification
makes it possible its extension to a wide range of modal logics in a uniform
way. This work also combines theoretical and experimental results for random
SAT and IFIP benchmarks.

<h2>Reasoning about Actions</h2>


<P>The Situation Calculus is the most used formalism for reasoning about
actions in Artificial Intelligence. Its expressive richness allows the integration
of various aspects of dynamic systems in a unique formalism. For this
flexibility it has been chosen by several research projects on reasoning about
actions, including the Cognitive Robotics Project at the University of Toronto.
In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lesp-leve-IJCAI-97.html">[DGLL97]</A> techniques originally developed to
assign a "structural operational semantics" to concurrent processes in Process



Algebra are used to formalize concurrent (complex) actions in the Situation
Calculus. Concurrent actions are specified as programs of a special "logical"
programming language called Congolog, which is able to express concurrency,
interrupts, shared memory massage passing between processes, etc. Congolog's
programs are designed to be executed on partially specified environments
where exogenous (external) events may occur at any time. The frame problem
is dealt with by suitably composing Reiter's solution for atomic actions.
<P>The language of the Situation Calculus is further extended in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-96.html">[EA96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-96a.html">[Err96b]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-96c.html">[Err96a]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-97.html">[Err97]</A> in order to deal with the cognitive state of agents acting in
a dynamic environment. The new ontology allows for the expression of
cognitive attitudes representing agents' beliefs and goals. Thus many issues
concerning the theory of agent can be tackled on top of the existing theory of
action. On the one hand, structural relationships and formal properties among
the attitudes are characterized. Furthermore the adequacy of the ontology is
analyzed and discussed with respect to applications concerning user modeling
problems for Intelligent Interactive Systems and student modeling problems
for Intelligent Tutoring Systems. On the other hand, the dynamic evolution of
the attitudes is formalized by means of suitable cognitive actions expressing
changes of agents' mental state.
<P>An alternative way of reasoning about actions is studied in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-chen-96.html">[DGC96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/chen-degi-AIJ-97.html">[CDG97]</A>, where a "model
checking" approach in contrast to the usual "validity checking" one is followed.
A dynamic system is modeled, by means of a suitable description formalism (a
process algebra), as a transition graph which represents all the possible system
evolutions in terms of state changes caused by actions. As reasoning
formalism, a suitable extension of modal mu-calculus is adopted. A Property
of the dynamic system is verified by checking the truth-value of a formula, in
the corresponding transition graph (model checking). This setting inherits
from the vast literature on process algebras tools for dealing with complex
systems, treating suitably important aspects like parallelism, communications,
interruptions, coordinations among agents. Moreover reasoning by model
checking (which presuppose complete information on the behavior of the
system) is typically much easier than more general logical services such as
validity checking.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-etal-96.html">[DGINR96a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/DINR-96.html">[DGINR96b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/DINR-96-b.html">[DGINR96c]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/DINR-96-c.html">[DGINR96d]</A> the studies on a
mobile robot equipped with autonomous reasoning capabilities is presented.
The robot, making use of such capabilities, is able to reason on the surrounding
environment and on the actions available in order to derive a plan for reaching
specified goals (as moving around in an office environment). The reasoning
services are based on a formalization of reasoning about actions and planning
in propositional dynamic logics, and exploit the correspondence between PDLs
and DLs to take advantage of efficient forms of weakened reasoning.



      <h2>Complexity of reasoning</h2>


      <P>Efficiency of AI systems is important for their success, as it is important in
      all engineering projects. If we are to use logic as the major tool for Knowledge
      Representation and Reasoning we have to deal with computational aspects.
      <P>Logical inference is an extraordinarily powerful computational device, and
      problems in logic are known among computer scientists for their high
      computational complexity. As an example, the prototypical recursively
      enumerable, non-recursive problem is to check whether a formula of first-order
      logic is consistent. In other words a reasoner that represents its knowledge by
      means of a first-order formula and uses a sound and complete procedure for
      checking the consistency of its knowledge has as much computational power as
      a Turing machine. The reasoner might give up full expressiveness and
      represent its knowledge in formulae of propositional logic, still using a sound
      and complete consistency checking procedure. In this case, it is important to
      recall that checking whether a formula of propositional logic is consistent is
      the paradigmatic NP-complete problem, which means that such a reasoner has
      as much computational power as a non-deterministic, polynomial-time Turing
      machine.
      <P>In 1996, the AI group has continued the investigation on fundamental
      properties of complexity of reasoning, with the overall goal of designing
      computationally efficient and adequately expressive systems for Knowledge
      Representation and Reasoning. In particular, research has focused on the
      following topics: <OL>
      <LI> computational complexity of specific logical formalisms;

      <LI> complexity and expressiveness of query languages for relational
           databases, which are based on knowledge representation ideas;

      <LI> logical compilation of knowledge;

      <LI> experimental analysis of computationally hard problems;

<LI>  approximation of logical inference to gain efficiency. </OL>
      <P>As for point 1, an extensive analysis of the "tractability threshold" of
      several propositional multivalued logics is performed in
      <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-scha-96.html">[CS96]</A>. The papers
      <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97-c.html">[Lib97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97.html">[Lib97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-scha-96.html">[LS96]</A> contain the
      analysis of complexity of various problems of belief revision. The
      computational gap between logic of context and modal logics is analyzed and
      some indications are derived for the use of either formalism in practice, in
      <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96.html">[Mas96b]</A>.
      <P>As for point 2, the language DQL (Default Query Language) is proposed in
      <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-eite-gott-97.html">[CEG97]</A>, and both its expressive power and complexity
      are analyzed. DQL is based on the well-known non-monotonic formalism of
      "default logic". The effects on the expressive power of a rule-based query



language when integrated with a description logic knowledge base are
investigated in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-palo-lenz-96.html">[CPL96]</A>.
<P>As for point 3, an extensive analysis of the benefits that preprocessing
(compiling) a non-monotonic knowledge base may have on the complexity of
reasoning is performed, in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-doni-scha-96.html">[CDS96]</A>. A specific
investigation on the effects on the size of data structures that the logical
compilation produces is carried out in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-95-b.html">[CDSS95]</A>. Such an
investigation is done for formulas which are the result of the revision or update
of a knowledge base in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-96-d.html">[CDLS96]</A>. The paper
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-96.html">[Lib96]</A> contains the results of an investigation on how
preprocessing may be useful in diagnostic problems. Specific formal tools, such
as complexity classes and reductions, for capturing the intuitive idea of a
"compilable" and "non-compilable" problem are proposed in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-96.html">[CDLS96a]</A>. Such tools are customized in the realm of
Knowledge Representation in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-96-b.html">[CDLS96b]</A>, showing among
other things that there are famous logical formalisms that have equal
computational complexity, but radically different possibilities of being usefully
preprocessed. Finally, the notes of a panel on "knowledge compilation" held
during an international conference have been produced <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-96.html">[Cad96]</A>.
<P>As for point 4, the results of an extensive experimental analysis are shown
in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-96-c.html">[CGGetal96]</A>. The analysis concerns the so called
"quantified boolean formulae", which provide prototypical problems for many
complexity classes extremely relevant to Knowledge Representation.
<P>As for point 5, the paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96-c.html">[Mas96c]</A> advocates the
introduction of approximate proofs within automated deduction for classical
and non-classical logics to overcome the computational barriers that make
deduction unfeasible in practice. The notion of approximate proofs is the
proof-theoretic dual of the notions of approximate semantics for tractable
reasoning.



<P><h2>Knowledge-Based Architectures for Planning and Scheduling</h2>


<P>The work concerns the realization of flexible architectures for planning and
scheduling with particular attention to the use of specialized constraint
management modules. The research has focussed on different aspects involved
in the design of such architectures.
<P>Specialized reasoning on time and resource constraints. Quantitative
temporal networks without disjunctive constraints are considered. The
problem is known as the Simple Temporal Problem. Dynamic management
algorithms are considered to be coupled with incremental constraint posting
approaches to problem solving. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/CeO96a.html">[CO96a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/CeO97.html">[CO97]</A> a
basic algorithm for incremental propagation of a new time constraint is
presented based on a modification of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for Single



Source Shortest Path Problem. For this algorithm a sufficient condition for
inconsistency is given based on cycle detection in the shortest paths graph.
Moreover, the problem of constraint retraction from a consistent situation is
considered and properties for re-propagating the network locally are exploited.
<P>The problem of resource reasoning in planning has been addressed, and
seen as integrated with temporal reasoning by defining a Time and Resource
Problem (T RP) in which two kinds of constraint are considered. Taking into
account the resource constraints makes the problem exponential, so only
partial algorithms for filtering the search space are possible in polynomial
time. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Ste96.html">[Ste96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/CSt96.html">[CS96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/CSt97.html">[CS97]</A> two filtering
techniques that propagate resource constraints have been proposed that
synthesize necessary quantitative and qualitative temporal constraints.
<P>Representation Formalisms. The work on the specialized language DDL.1
for representing planning domain knowledge has been continued and described
in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/CeO96b.html">[CO96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/CeO96c.html">[CO96b]</A>. DDL.1 representation adopts
basic ideas from control theory extended to allow the specification of
constraints. The planning problem is seen as the problem of deciding the
behavior of a dynamic domain.
<P>A different approach to a similar problem has been followed in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/CCC97.html">[CMCA97]</A> where a logical approach to planning is used, based on
the view of a planning activity as the search for a finite model of the
specification of the planning problem. The modal temporal language used to
represent planning problems is based on a discrete, linear model of time and
the execution mechanism is based upon model construction techniques related
to analytic tableaux.
<P>Problem Solving Heuristics. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/OdS96.html">[OS96]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/OdS97.html">[OS97]</A> the
use of stochastic variable and value ordering heuristics for solving job shop
scheduling problems with non-relaxable deadlines and complex metric
constraints is investigated. Previous research in constraint satisfaction
scheduling has developed highly effective, deterministic heuristics for this class
of problems based on simple measures of temporal sequencing flexibility.
However, they are not infallible, and the possibility of search failure raises the
issue of how to most productively enlarge the search. This work designs an
iterative sampling procedure, based on the intuition that it is more productive
to deviate from heuristic advice in cases where the heuristic is less informed,
and likewise better to follow the heuristic in cases where it is more
knowledgeable. Stochastic counterparts to previously developed search
heuristics are specified, which are parameterized to calibrate degree of
randomness to level of discriminatory power.
<P>The interaction with the user. In two different application domains, the
scheduling of a data-relay satellite system and the management of medical
resources, the problem of the interaction with the user is addressed. In both
cases work is underway to build Decision Support Systems where the problem
to manage resources is solved by a process of collaborative problem solving



      between a user and an automated system. The need for a mixed-initiative
      interaction with the user sets up a certain number of design constraints that
      are currently investigated.

      <h2>Constraint Reasoning and Scheduling</h2>


      <P>Constraint programming and constraint solving are emergent fields in
      Artificial Intelligence. We specifically investigated to what extent constraint
      programming techniques can be useful for solving various real-case scheduling
      problems, like timetabling. In particular, we worked in three different
      directions.
      <P><OL>
     <LI> We developed implementations for solution of real cases of scheduling
          problems using conventional programming languages. The research
          regards the solution of large scale timetabling problems using local search
          techniques and, in particular, tabu search. Such research involves the
          definition of a standard formulation of the problem <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha97.html">[Sch97]</A>,
          the representation of both the search space and the neighborhood relation,
          and the implementation of the search procedures <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha96.html">[Sch96b]</A>.

     <LI> We developed tools and implementations for the solution of real cases of
          scheduling problems using existing constraint languages. We worked on
          the use of the Constraint Logic Programming language ECLiP Se for the
          solution of the above mentioned problems <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha96c.html">[Sch96a]</A>.

<LI>  We are working on the extension of the theoretical framework of the constraint
      programming paradigm so as to embed some features that can be useful for
      modeling scheduling problems <A HREF="/~ai/citations/ApSc97.html">[AS97]</A>. </OL>



      <P><h2>Natural language processing</h2>


      <P>During 1996 a collaboration with the IRST (Istituto per la Ricerca
      Scientifica e Tecnologica) and with Finsiel SpA on themes related to natural
      language processing has been continued. This collaboration was centered on
      theoretical and technological issues related to the automatic generation of
      hypertextual descriptions from conceptual models. This work was motivated
      by the consideration that while conceptual model validation is crucial in the
      information system development process, it may be difficult to accomplish if
      the domain expert is not acquainted with the formal language used by the
      analyst. Textual natural-language descriptions of the model are often suitable
      for this purpose, and valuable analyst time could be saved if these texts could
      be produced automatically: the combination of natural language and
      hypertext significantly lowers the communicative barrier between the analyst
      and the domain expert, thus increasing validation effectiveness. In this frame,
      an experimental prototype called SAX <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Cancedda-et-al-97.html">[CKPP97]</A> has



been realized and will serve as a basis for the development of a fully-fledged
system. The prototype is based on a hybrid approach, with a text planner
based on recursive expansion of communicative schemata for the general
organization of the text and a superficial module supporting flexible templates
for sentence-level generation. This solution achieves the desired trade-off
between robustness and portability across domains on one side and text
fluency on the other.
