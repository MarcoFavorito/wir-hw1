<H1> On the Complexity of Reasoning with Negation As Failure </H1>

<H2> Abstract </H2>

In this work we study the computational properties of the propositional
fragment of MBNF, the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure
introduced by Lifschitz, which can be considered as a unifying framework
for several nonmonotonic formalisms.  In particular, the logic MBNF has
been used in order to give a declarative semantics to very general classes
of logic programs with negation.  We characterize the complexity and
present algorithms for entailment in various subclasses of propositional
MBNF.  In particular, we show that reasoning in propositional MBNF is
$\Pi^p_3$-complete, whereas it is $\Pi^p_2$-complete in the case of MBNF
theories without nested occurrences of the modalities.
