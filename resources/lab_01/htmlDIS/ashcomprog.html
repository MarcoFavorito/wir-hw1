<H3><A NAME="SCHOOL">Part I-School (September
10-13 and 16-17, 1996)</A></H3>

During the School, a state-of-the-art presentation of both basic and
advanced results concerning approximation algorithms and
approximability of hard problems will be extensively developed.

Some of the main topics that will be addressed are:

<DL>
<DD> Approximability classes and approximation preserving reducibilities
<DD> Limits to approximability
<DD> Advanced approximation techniques
<DD> Mathematical programming and approximation algorithms
<DD> Approximation in set problems
<DD> Approximation in graph problems
<DD> Parallel approximation algorithms
<DD> Heuristics
</DL>

The lectures will be organized on a basis of six hours per day for a
total of 36 hours.

During the Workshop new results concerning the topics of the School
will
be presented by some of the most active researchers in the field.
Approximately twenty papers will be presented. A selection of the
papers will be invited for a special issue of Theoretical Computer
Science.
