  This paper describes an analyst-oriented approach to conceptual knowledge
  representation and reasoning based on description logics. The approach is
  introduced to model and analyse the static part of behavioural concepts
  used in application domains. Behaviours are captured in a parametric way
  with respect to the description logic which corresponds to the structural
  modelling language. Structural concepts are classified according to the usual
  ISA hierarchy, while behaviours are organised into a hierarchy based on
  countervariance. Reasoning about the domain model is performed in terms
  of subsumption and consistency in the adopted description logic, and
  complexity results carry over. The proposed approach is used to formalise
  and reason on process schemes introduced in the engineering of
  computer-based and information systems, as well as in enterprise modelling.
