<H2><font color=purple><i>Bioinformatics Adventures in Database Research, <br>
by Limsoon Wong</i></font></H2>
<p>

Informatics has helped launch molecular biology into the genomic era. It
appears certain that informatics will continue to be a major contributor to
the success of molecular biology in the post-genome era. In this paper, we
discuss our experience of data integration and datamining in bioinformatics,
as well as the role that database theory played in these topics. We also
describe LIMS as a third key topic in bioinformatics where advances in
database system and theory can be very relevant.  (Joint work with Jinyan Lee
and See-Kiong Ng)

<H2><font color=purple><i>Approximations in Database Systems, <br>
by Yannis Ioannidis</i></font></H2>
<p>

The need for approximations of information has become very
critical in the recent past.  From traditional query optimization
to newer functionality like user feedback and knowledge discovery,
data management systems require quick delivery of approximate data
in order to serve their goals.  There are several techniques that
have been proposed to solve the problem, each with its own
strengths and weaknesses.  In this talk, we will take a look
at some of the most important data approximation problems and
put them side by side with some of the most prominent techniques
that have been proposed to solve them.  We will then hint on some
open problems that appear whose solution would have some great
impact in the area.

<H2><font color=purple><i>Open Problems in Peer-to-Peer Systems, <br>
by Hector Garcia-Molina</i></font></H2>
<p>

In a Peer-To-Peer (P2P) system, autonomous computers at the "edge" of
the network pool their resources, e.g., files, storage, compute
cycles, in order to inexpensively handle tasks that would normally
require large costly servers.  Current P2P systems include Morpheus,
Gnutella, Seti@Home, and have hundreds of thousands of users.  The
scale of these systems, their "open nature" and the lack of
centralized control, pose tough performance and security challenges.
In this talk I will present a "taxonomy" of P2P research areas,
including search, resource management, and security.  In addition, I
will discuss particular open problems, and briefly summarize some
ongoing research efforts at Stanford.
