<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In this talk, I will give an overview of an approach
developed with Hector Levesque, Ray Reiter, and others, to provide effective
reasoning capabilities to robots and software agents that operate in real
environments. The framework is based on the Situation calculus, a language
of predicate logic for representing dynamic domains. In real applications,
plan synthesis is often too inefficient. Instead, we take our agents to
be executing high-level programs that have been largely pre-scripted. We
have extended the Situation Calculus with a language for expressing such
high-level programs, i.e., complex actions. This yields a programming language
whose primitive instructions are domain-dependent actions that the robot
can perform and whose tests contain predicates that are affected by these
actions. These are specified in a Situation Calculus domain theory. Programs
can contain nondeterministic choice points where lookahead is necessary
to make a choice that leads to succesful termination. As in planning, reasoning
about the preconditions and effects of actions is required to find a sequence
of actions that constitutes a legal execution of the high-level program.
The programmer can control the search effort required by using nondeterminism
judiciously. Our framework includes a solution to the frame problem and
supports the modeling of knowledge and knowledge-producing actions. A logic
programming implementation of the language has been developed. We will
illustrate the use of the framework using robotics applications. </FONT></P>
