<br>
A large interest in the concept of dynamic reconfigurability has 
been growing in the last decade. 
The main motivation being that reconfigurable computing gives the promise
of delivering an order of magnitude performance improvement over
traditional processors.
    In order to explore the reconfiguration potential a number of abstract
models have been defined and used as a support for many parallel
algorithms which exploit this potential in non trivial ways. Devices with
reconfiguration capabilities are now commercially available and being used
to demostrate the practical advantage of reconfigurable computing over
general purpose processors. However, at the state of the art, theoretical
models are far from the real world.
   In this talk we will overview both theoretical and practical research
in reconfigurable computing we have been working on, giving a flavour of
the main issues that need to be addressed in both areas.
