                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Many
                   recent works point out that there are several possibilities of assigning a meaning to a concept definition containing some sort
                   of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a
                   single style of semantics, we achieve a better result by adopting a
                   formalism allowing for different semantics to coexist. In order to
                   demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we present a knowledge representation language with the above characteristics. The
                   language is a powerful concept language where, besides the usual
                   constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, and quantifiers,
                   both qualified number restrictions, and recursive definitions are


                   allowed. Notably, these features make our formalism one of the
                   most powerful concept languages proposed in literature, in which
                   the  usual  frame-based  descriptions  can  be  combined  with  definitions of data structures such as lists, directed acyclic graphs,
                   streams, etc. We show that reasoning in our language is decidable,
                   and we characterize its computational complexity by resorting to
                   a  correspondence  with  the  modal  mu-calculus  interpreted  over
                   deterministic structures.<p>
