                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this paper the
                   role of Student Modeling in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)
                   and the implications of this research area for User Modeling are
                   explored from an Artificial Intelligence perspective. User Modeling is a central activity for Adaptive Interactive Systems. We
                   are particularly concerned with systems providing consultation,
                   presentation, help, training and tutoring about a specific domain,
                   where the perceptions of the system about the user are taken into
                   account in order to make the interaction more individualized on
                   the basis of her/his needs and characteristics. We critically examine some existing ITSs, present a rational reconstruction, based
                   on first-order logic, of their Student Modeling activity, and discuss relationships with User Modeling.<p>
