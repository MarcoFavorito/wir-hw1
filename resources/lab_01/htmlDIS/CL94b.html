                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Current   objectoriented data models lack several important features that would
                   allow one to express relevant knowledge about the classes of a
                   schema. In particular, there is no data model supporting simultaneously the inverse of the functions represented by attributes,
                   the  union,  the  intersection  and  the  complement  of  classes,  the
                   possibility of using nonbinary relations, and the possibility of expressing  cardinality  constraints  on  attributes  and  relations.  In
                   this paper we define a new data model, called CAR, which extends the basic core of current object-oriented data models with
                   all the above mentioned features. A technique is then presented
                   both for checking the consistency of class definitions, and for computing the logical consequences of the knowledge represented in
                   the schema. Finally, the inherent complexity of reasoning in CAR
                   is investigated, and the complexity of our inferencing technique
                   is studied, depending on various assumptions on the schema.<p>
