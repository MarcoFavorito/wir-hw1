Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for
designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological



languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view
a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs.
The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be
summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive
terminological language, called ALCN R    , including general complements of
concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to
express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological
cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of
desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and
instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for
reasoning in ALCN R    -knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general
technique of cs s. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that
inclusion statements in ALCN R    can be simulated by terminological cycles, if
descriptive semantics is adopted.
