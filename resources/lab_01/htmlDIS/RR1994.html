<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Research Report 1994</H2>

Algorithmic Engineering is mainly concerned with the study of the intrinsic
complexity of problems, the design of algorithmic techniques for their
efficient solution and the test of such techniques in real-world situations.
<P>
In this area the research work at DIS in 1994 was carried on in the following
directions:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#APPROXIMATION">approximate solution of NP-hard combinatorial problems</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#GRAPHS">graph and combinatorial algorithms</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#GEOMETRY">computational geometry and spatial data management</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#ON-LINE">on-line algorithms</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#DISTRIBUTED">distributed and network algorithms</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#PROBABILISTIC">probabilistic analysis of algorithms</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#LEARNING">computational learning theory</A>.
</UL>

<H3>1.<HT><A NAME="APPROXIMATION">Approximate solution of NP-hard optimization problems</A></H3>

Due to their intrinsic complexity, for NP-hard optimization problems we cannot
hope to find efficient general solution algorithms and we need to restrict
ourselves to approximate solutions. Hence, the study of approximate algorithms
for NP-hard optimization problems has a considerable importance both from the
theoretical point of view and with respect to the practical aim of designing
efficient approximation algorithms which are guaranteed to provide a solution
whithin a maximum relative error.
<P>
In this area two research directions have been taken. Along the first
direction the class of problems that can be efficiently approximated by means of
local search algorithms has been defined and its properties analyzed [<A HREF="#I2-8">I2-8</A>], and
more powerful local search approximation tecniques have been introduced [<A HREF="#I2-1">I2-1</A>,
<A HREF="#I2-R-1">I2-R-1</A>]. Besides, along the second line, a survey of the main research results in
the characterization of approximate problems has been prepared [<A HREF="#I2-5">I2-5</A>].

<H3>2.<HT><A NAME="GRAPHS">Graph and combinatorial algorithms</A></H3>

In this area the research has been focusing on dynamic graph algorithms, on graph
drawing and on the design of data structures and of algorithmic techniques for
several combinatorial problems.
<P>
<U>Dynamic graph algorithms</U><T>
Dynamic graph algorithms are algorithms that maintain
some properties of a changing graph, more efficiently than a simple recomputation
from scratch after each change. In this area, many dynamic problems (such as
minimum spanning trees, edge and vertex connectivity, planarity testing, shortest
paths) have been efficiently solved, by designing novel data structures
and algorithmic techniques, on general graphs [<A HREF="#I2-19">I2-19</A>,<A HREF="#I2-31">I2-31</A>,<A HREF="#I2-36">I2-36</A>,<A HREF="#I2-R-6">I2-R-6</A>] and
planar graphs [<A HREF="#I2-22">I2-22</A>,<A HREF="#I2-31">I2-31</A>,<A HREF="#I2-34">I2-34</A>,<A HREF="#I2-R-7">I2-R-7</A>,<A HREF="#I2-R-10">I2-R-10</A>,<A HREF="#I2-R-11">I2-R-11</A>]. A characterization of
DFS-trees and its maintainance in a directed acyclic graph is studied in [<A HREF="#I2-28">I2-28</A>].
 Average case analysis of dynamic algorithms for directed graphs has been
considered in [<A HREF="#I2-R-2">I2-R-2</A>].
<P>
<U>Graph Drawing</U><T>
The problem of automatically drawing a graph is a classical
research theme. The recent results in this field concern the study of
series-parallel digraphs, st-digraphs, triconnected digraphs, and orthogonal
representations. A comprehensive survey on graph drawing is presented in
[<A HREF="#I2-16">I2-16</A>]. With regard to series-parallel digraphs, orthogonal representations and
cost functions of orthogonal representations are studied in [<A HREF="#I2-R-4">I2-R-4</A>], and
drawings with polynomial area requirement can be produced with the algorithms
presented in [<A HREF="#I2-9">I2-9</A>]. Upward planarity testing of triconnected graphs is studied
in [<A HREF="#I2-10">I2-10</A>]. Dynamic graph drawing problems are studied in [<A HREF="#I2-14">I2-14</A>,<A HREF="#I2-19">I2-19</A>] for
planar graphs, trees and convex planar graphs. Combinatorial properties of
triangular planar graphs are indagated in [<A HREF="#I2-R-5">I2-R-5</A>]. Experimental studies
comparing general-purpose graph drawing algorithms is carried out in [<A HREF="#I2-17">I2-17</A>].
<P>
<U>Data structures</U><T>
In the area of data structures, new data structures for the set
union problem with backtracking and for the tree reachability testing and path
searching problem have been designed and analyzed [<A HREF="#I2-4">I2-4</A>]. Algorithms and data
structures for the efficient updating of approximate solutions for bin-packing
are proposed in [<A HREF="#I2-32">I2-32</A>]. Finally, the dynamization of the constraint
satisfaction problem and of the satisfiability of a Horn formula with
uncertainty are addressed respectively in [<A HREF="#I2-30">I2-30</A>] and [<A HREF="#I2-33">I2-33</A>]. In [<A HREF="#I2-39">I2-39</A>] an
optimal data structure for representing the transitive closure of a lattice is
proposed.

<H3>3. <T><A NAME="GEOMETRY">Computational geometry and spatial data management</A></H3>

 The problem of characterizing the shape of geometric objects has been tackled in
many variants. [<A HREF="#I2-18">I2-18</A>] presents a survey of the argument. A complete
characterization of trees by means of proximity graphs is given in [<A HREF="#I2-12">I2-12</A>].
Classes of graphs admiting rectangle of influence drawing are characterized in
[<A HREF="#I2-21">I2-21</A>] while [<A HREF="#I2-13">I2-13</A>] investigates beta-drawings of graphs.
<P>
Classical problems in computational geometry are considered in [<A HREF="#I2-27">I2-27</A>], that
presents an optimal online algorithm for computing a series of approximations of
the convex hull of a planar set, and in [<A HREF="#I2-29">I2-29</A>] that applies theory of partial
orders to half-plane search.
<P>
A parallel data structure for network flow problems in planar graphs that
finds applcations to spatial data management is proposed in [<A HREF="#I2-3">I2-3</A>].

<H3>4.<T><A NAME="ON-LINE">On-line algorithms</A></H3>
On-line problems require to satisfy each request in a sequence without knowledge
of future requests. The goal is to serve efficiently the entire sequence of
requests. Problems of memory paging for structured information (as for example
graphs or sets) have been tackled. The case in which the underlying data
structure is a graph and queries are about the connectivity or the existing paths
between pairs of nodes has been solved in [<A HREF="#I2-R-8">I2-R-8</A>]. Moreover, the case in which
a set of items are requested to be contemporarily in the cache memory is studied
in [<A HREF="#I2-23">I2-23</A>].
<P>
A methodology for on-line scheduling problems based on linear programming has
been proposed in [<A HREF="#I2-37">I2-37</A>]. The methodology finds many applications, for instance
to the scheduling and routing of communications in computer networks.
<P>
In [<A HREF="#I2-6">I2-6</A>, <A HREF="#I2-R-3">I2-R-3</A>] it has been considered the problem of scheduling a server
in a metric space as to cover a set of requests given in on-line fashion.
Competitive algorithms that update efficiently the route of a server when new
requests are presented have been proposed for various metric spaces.
<P>
The list update problem consists of implementing a dictionary in a
sequential list. In [<A HREF="#I2-15">I2-15</A>] the heuristic move-to-front, that moves the accessed
information to the beginning of the list, is studied when set of items rather
than single items must be retrieved.

<H3>5.<T><A NAME="DISTRIBUTED">Distributed and network algorithms</A></H3>

In [<A HREF="#I2-R-9">I2-R-9</A>] the Boolean Routing model is considered and it is shown that it
provides optimal representations of all shortest routes on many specific network
topologies. The problem of devising interval routing schemes for chordal ring
networks is considered in [<A HREF="#I2-25">I2-25</A>], and in [<A HREF="#I2-26">I2-26</A>] it is shown that Interval
Routing schemes in general cannot significantly reduce space requirements.
<P>
The problem of finding the extrema in a distributed multiset is considered in
[<A HREF="#I2-2">I2-2</A>]. It corresponds to determining the minimum and the maximum value of a
multiset whose elements are drawn from a totally ordered universe and stored at
the entity of a ring network.
Finally, in [<A HREF="#I2-11">I2-11</A>] a new scheme for deadlock resolution is proposed.

<H3>6.<T><A NAME="PROBABILISTIC">Probabilistic analysis of algorithms</A></H3>

In [<A HREF="#I2-38">I2-38</A>] an on-line version of the knapsack problem has been considered from a
probabilistic point of view; in the paper it is shown how an adaptive strategy
finds a solution that is very close to the optimal solution.

<H3> 7.<T><A NAME="LEARNING">Computational Learning Theory</A></H3>

The problem of learning boolean formulae from examples has been considered. In
[<A HREF="#I2-35">I2-35</A>] polynomial algorithms for learning disjunctive formulae under classes of
probability distributions are presented. In [<A HREF="#I2-24">I2-24</A>] is faced the problem of
learning boolean formulae in the PAC model under the assumption that the examples
are drawn according to a product distribution.
