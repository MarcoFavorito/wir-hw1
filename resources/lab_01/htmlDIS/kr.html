 <H2>Knowledge Representation</H2>
    The goal of this research is to study the foundations of a logical approach
to structured knowledge representation languages, with regard to both the expressive  power  and  the  computational  properties  of  the  associated  reasoning
techniques <A HREF="BLNPS94.html">[BLNPS94]</A>.<p>
    The definition of knowledge bases by means of structured knowledge representation  languages  is  done  by  specifying  a  terminological  knowledge  base,


where  concepts  are  defined,  along  with  an  assertional  knowledge  base,  where
facts about individuals are stated in terms of these concepts.  After the studies
of the complexity of reasoning on concept expressions, current research has focussed on instance checking (verifying whether an individual is an instance of
a concept) and explicit representation of epistemic knowledge into a knowledge
base.  A comprehensive overview of the results of this approach can be found
<A HREF="Sch94a.html">[Sch94a]</A>.<p>
    The question of whether instance checking can be solved by means of subsumption algorithms has been tackled in <A HREF="DLNS94.html">[DLNS94]</A>.  Different methods for the
instance checking problem are shown and a complexity analysis of this problem
is provided.  A major result is that there are cases where instance checking is
inherently more difficult than subsumption.<p>
    The issue has been further studied in <A HREF="Sch94b.html">[Sch94b]</A> where language constructors
for the amalgamation of terminological and assertional knowledge bases have
been considered.  In particular,  one of these attempts is based on letting the
individuals to be referenced in the concept expressions by admitting a constructor for building a concept from a set of enumerated individuals.  In the cited
paper the consequences of introducing this type of constructors in the concept
description language are studied both in term of complete reasoning procedures
and of computational complexity.  At the same time the possibility of refining
the structure of the terminological knowledge base into schema and views has
been studied in <A HREF="BDNS94.html">[BDNS94]</A>.  The terminological schemata play a role similar to
that of a database schema, i.e. frame-like structures where typing information
are introduced through primitive concepts and primitive roles.  On the other
hand, views on the objects in the knowledge base are provided through defined
concepts.  Language,  definitions,  semantics  and  computational  properties  are
described for three case studies concerning implemented systems.<p>
    The enhancement of concept languages with epistemic operators is investigated in <A HREF="DLNetal94.html">[DLNetal94]</A>.  The results of this work have a twofold importance.  From
the point of view of epistemic logics, the contribution is the identification of an
effective procedure for the problem of answering epistemic queries posed to a
knowledge base defined in a highly expressive concept language.  From the point
of view of concept languages, the most relevant aspect of the work is that several
common features of existing knowledge representation systems are reconstructed
in logic.  Epistemic operators provide a highly expressive query language, allow
for the treatment of several database features, such as closed-world reasoning
and integrity constraints and, finally, can give a formal characterization of some
procedural mechanisms, such as trigger rules, usually considered in frame-based
systems.<p>
    The recently established correspondence between Description Logics (concept languages) and Propositional Dynamic Logics has brought to a fruitful relationship and migration of results between these two fields.  A general overview
of main results, scientific and practical possibilities can be found in <A HREF="DGL94e.html">[DGL94e]</A><A HREF="DG95.html">[DG95]</A>.<p>


    This correspondence has been the basis to introduce powerful Description
Logics which do not correspond to any studied Propositional Dynamic Logic.<p>
In particular decidability and complexity characterization have been established
by <A HREF="DGL94a.html">[DGL94a]</A> for Description Logics, which allow for "functional restrictions",
"qualified  number  restrictions",  "inverse  roles",  "assertions  on  concepts"  and
"assertions on single objects".  In <A HREF="DGL94d.html">[DGL94d]</A> it is shown that n-ary relations can
be correctly modeled in this setting.<p>
    An enhanced Description Logic with constructs for specifying classes of aggregate  objects  is  introduced  in  <A HREF="DGL95b.html">[DGL95b]</A>,  where  decidability  and  computational properties are also established.  It is possible to define classes of tuples
(n-ary relations), subclasses, sets and "key" attributes, in the spirit of object
oriented models.  In addition, the logic contains a controlled form of "role value
map".<p>
    Semantical problems for the assignment of a meaning to a recursive concept
definitions have been tackled in <A HREF="DGL94b.html">[DGL94b]</A>, by adopting a formalism where different semantics coexist.  The resulting Description Logic captures definitions of
data structures such as lists, directed acyclic graphs, streams, etc.  Decidability
and computational properties are derived by establishing a correspondence with
the modal mu-calculus.<p>
    Decidability and computational properties for Propositional Dynamic Logics
which  allow  for  several  forms  of  program  determinism  have  been  studied  in
<A HREF="DGL94c.html">[DGL94c]</A>.  In particular it is proven that the introduction of graded modalities
makes the logic strictly more expressive than "Converse Deterministic PDL",
but still decidable in deterministic exponential time.<p>
    A  powerful  Propositional  Dynamic  Logics  for  reasoning  about  actions  (in
the style of the "situation calculus") have been investigated in <A HREF="DGL95a.html">[DGL95a]</A>, thus
providing  decidability  result  and  tight  computational  complexity  analysis.  A
formalism is proposed that allows for boolean expressions denoting sets of primitive actions executed concurrently and also interdependencies between primitive
actions as specialization or disjointness..<p>
    Structured knowledge representation languages bear similarities to database
models, and allow to enhance their expressive power <A HREF="Len94.html">[Len94]</A>.  A concept language, powerful enough to model frame systems, object-oriented database languages and semantic data models, is shown in <A HREF="CLN94.html">[CLN94]</A>. The high expressivity of
the language (and the need for capturing reasoning in different contexts) forces
to  distinguish  between  unrestricted  and  finite  model  reasoning.   It  is  shown
that reasoning is decidable in both cases.  This is achieved by a correspondence
with propositional dynamic logic for unrestricted model reasoning and by linear
programming techniques for finite model reasoning.  The work is extended in
<A HREF="CL94b.html">[CL94b]</A> where the data model is enhanced and a detailed complexity analysis is
presented.  The new model expresses also disjointness and disjunction of classes
and more general constraints on the connections that may exist between classes,
without sacrificing decidability of reasoning with respect to finite models.  The
complexity analysis provides tight upper and lower bounds for the general case,


and singles out important practical cases where the decision procedure is efficient.<p>
    The interaction between different types of constraints has been further analyzed for semantic data models in <A HREF="CL94c.html">[CL94c]</A>, namely ISA and cardinality constraints.  A  sound  and  complete  method  is  proposed  for  reasoning  effectively
about a set of ISA and cardinality constraints to check either the satisfiability
of a schema or whether a schema implies a given constraint.<p>
