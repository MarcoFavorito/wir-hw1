A  School and a Workshop on "Models and Algorithms for the Web"  will 
be held in  Udine (north-eastern part of Italy),  in the period June 
17 - 22, 2002, under the auspices of the EU  projects IST FET ALCOM-FT 
(Algorithms and Complexity in Future  Technologies) and IST FET COSIN
(Coevolution and Self-organization in  Dynamical Networks) and UNESCO.

The aim of the School is to provide researchers (especially young
researchers) in computer science, physics, social sciences and related
fields with a broad and consistent overview of the most important recent
progresses  in the area of models and algorithms for the Web.  The
subsequent Workshop will be the occasion for the presentation of ongoing 
research work in the area.
