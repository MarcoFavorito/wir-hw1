                   reasoning is a common nonmonotonic technique that allows for
                   dealing with negative information in knowledge and data bases.<p>
                   Several forms of closed world reasoning have been proposed in
                   the literature, ranging from the closed world assumption, introduced in the context of data bases, to the extended closed world
                   assumption, which is equivalent to circumscription. The aim of
                   this paper is to present a detailed analysis of the computational
                   complexity  of  the  different  forms  of  closed  world  reasoning  for
                   various fragments of propositional logic. Such an analysis allows
                   us to draw a complete picture of the boundary between tractability and intractability of such a form of nonmonotonic reasoning.<p>
                   We also discuss how to use our results in order to characterize
                   the computational complexity of other nonmonotonic reasoning
                   problems, namely nonmonotonic inheritance, diagnosis, and default reasoning.<p>
