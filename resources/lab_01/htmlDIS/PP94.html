                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Logic   programming with abductive reasoning is used during the realization of
                   a data dictionary with a particular methodology. Some methodological  steps  are  represented  by  means  of  a  set  of  rules  augmented with integrity constraints which capture the presence of
                   incompatible concepts. Explanations for incompatibility can be
                   inferred by exploiting abductive reasoning. To this end a new proposal for the computation of hypotheses in an abductive framework where the theory is a general logic program, is presented.<p>
                   It is based on a suitable manipulation of minimal three-valued


                   models of the logic program. A method to compute three-valued
                   minimal models of a general logic program is given.<p>
