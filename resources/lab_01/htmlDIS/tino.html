<B>Tino</B> is a mobile robot platform of the
<A HREF="http://www.ai.sri.com/people/erratic/">Erratic</A> family,
developed at <A HREF="http://www.ai.sri.com/">SRI International</A>,
quite suitable for operating within an office environment.
It is equipped with two independent driving wheels
and a free-wheeling castor, while
sensoring capabilities are provided by seven ultrasonic range finders
placed in the front of the platform.
Detailed <A HREF="hw.html">hardware specifications</A> 
of the Erratic base are also available.<BR>

The robot is remote controlled from a host computer through a 
wireless communication.
Control software runs on the remote workstation and
real-time capabilities are obtained by means of a 10 Hz communication with
the mobile platform.<BR>

<H3>ARCHITECTURE</H3>
<P>
<B>Tino</B> is based on a layered architecture, which combines a reactive
control mechanism with a reasoning system.
At the lower level a <A HREF="control.html">fuzzy controller</A>
is responsible for reactively executing primitive actions,
while at the upper level a <A HREF="reason.html">reasoning system</A>
is used to achieve high-level goals.
The integration of planning and reactivity is obtained by means of
a monitor,
which both translates data representation between the two
levels (allowing for a heterogeneous implementation)
and checks whether the execution of actions leads to the accomplishment
of the goals.
</P>


<H3>RESEARCH WORK</H3>
<P>
The main goal of our research work is to provide autonomous reasoning
capabilities to the robot by devising a principled and practically
feasible realization of a 
<A HREF="reason.html">KR&R approach for reasoning about actions</A>.
Specifically, the basis of our proposal for reasoning about
actions is provided by Propositional Dynamic Logics (PDLs).
However, the implementation has been obtained by relying on the tight
correspondence that exists between PDLs and Description Logics (DLs).
By exploiting this correspondence we have been able both to develop
an interesting theoretical framework for reasoning about actions and to
obtain an implementation that uses a knowledge representation system based
on DLs.<BR>

In fact, a general knowledge representation system based on DLs 
(CLASSIC) is used to represent the robot's knowledge
about the environment and the actions it can perform.

The reasoning services of CLASSIC allow the robot to deductively 
derive plans to achieve its goals,
while its reactive capabilities 
allow it to execute its plans in the real world.
</P>

<H3>EXPERIMENTS</H3>
<P>
Experiments involve navigation tasks in an office-like environment.
The robot accepts high-level goals, computes a plan whose performance
is expected to achieve the goal and reactively executes it in the world.<BR>

<A HREF="exp-mo.html">First experiments</A>
were focussed on using moving actions to reach a specified goal and
on the integration between the planning system and the fuzzy controller.
Recently we introduce in our framework sensing actions,
and we test them in some
<A HREF="exp-se.html">new experiments</A>.
