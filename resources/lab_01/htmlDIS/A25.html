  In this paper, we describe a plan-based model for the treatment of
  misunderstandings in NL cooperative dialogue: an utterance is considered
  coherent if it is related to some of the interactants' intentions by a relation
  of goal adherence, goal adoption or plan continuation. If none of them is
  fully satisfied, a misunderstanding is hypothesized and the goal of realigning
  the interactants' interpretation of the dialogue is adopted by the agent
  detecting the problem. This goal makes the agent restructure his own
  contextual interpretation, or induce his partner to do that, according to who
  made the mistake.
