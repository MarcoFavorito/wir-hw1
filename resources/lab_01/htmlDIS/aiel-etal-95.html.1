In knowledge representation several formalisms for reasoning about knowledge
in a multi agent scenario have been proposed.  More specifically, we can
identify a family of languages based on the use of a modal operator and
another one based on the use of first-order logic enriched with meta-level
capabilities.  In this paper we consider these two approaches by addressing the
issues of consistency that arise from self-referenciality, their expressiveness and
the methods for translating classical modal systems into meta-level first-order
formalisms.
