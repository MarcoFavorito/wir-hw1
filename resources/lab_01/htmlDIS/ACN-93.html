A basic feature of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) is their ability to
represent domain knowledge that can be attributed to the student at each
stage of the learning process.  In this paper we present a general (first order
logic) framework for the representation of this kind of knowledge acquired by
the system through the analysis of the student answers.  This represantation
makes it possible to describe the behaviour of well known ITSs and to provide
a direct implementation in a logic programming language.  Moreover, we point
out several improvements that can be easily achieved by exploiting the features
of a declarative approach.  In particular, we address the representation and use
of the knowledge that the system knows not to be possessed by the student.
