                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this paper we
                   provide a semantic characterization of ground logics, a family of
                   nonmonotonic  modal  logics  obtained  by  means  of  a  variant  of
                   the well known Mc Dermott and Doyle fixed point equation. The
                   term  ground  logics  carries  the  idea  of  restricting  the  negative
                   introspection capabilities of the reasoning agent to the objective
                   (i.e.  non  modal)  part  of  the  theory.  This  intuition  was  nicely
                   formalized for modal logic S5 by a semantic definition based on
                   a preference relation on Kripke models, which was obtained as the
                   semantic counterpart to the notion of minimal knowledge initially
                   defined by Halpern and Moses. We have then found a preference
                   relation  on  Kripke  models  that  both  generalizes  this  notion  of
                   minimal knowledge and provides a semantic characterization of
                   ground logics.<p>
