  The IFT (Information Filtering Tool) project has the goal of developing new
  approaches to information filtering which are based on user modeling
  techniques for building and managing the representation of the user
  information preferences. In this paper we describe three prototypes which
  have been developed and evaluated within the project. All of them are
  dealing with textual semistructured documents and exploit a semantic
  network representation of user preferences: the first two prototypes (IFTool
  and PIFT) are characterized by two different matching algorithms utilized
  for assessing the relevance of an incoming document against the user model,
  whereas the third (ifWeb) concerns an application of IFTool to the
  navigation and filtering of documents in the INTERNET. The three
  prototypes have been evaluated in order to compare their performance with
  similar systems presented in the literature. The results achieved show that
  information filtering can positively profit from user modeling techniques,
  and point out interesting challenges for future investigations.
