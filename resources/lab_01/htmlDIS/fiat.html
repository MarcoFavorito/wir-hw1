<br>
Experimental evidence suggests that spectral techniques are valuable for a
wide range of applications.  A partial list of such applications include (i)
semantic analysis of documents used to cluster documents into areas of 
interest, (ii) collaborative filtering - the reconstruction of missing data 
items, and (iii) determining the relative importance of documents based 
on citation/link structure.   Intuitive arguments can explain some of the 
phenomena that has been  observed but little theoretical study has been done. 
In this paper we give several theoretical results that justify the robustness 
of the spectral approach while allowing errors and missing data.  This gives 
strong  justification of the use of spectral techniques for latent semantic 
indexing,  collaborative filtering, and web site ranking.  We give sufficient 
conditions  under which spectral analysis will work, and make use of these 
results to  justify new algorithms for several applications.
