  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent advances in electronics 
    and wireless communication has made it viable to build networks composed of 
    a large number of sensors, cheap low-end devices that are small in size, are 
    battery powered, and communicate in short distances. Wireless sensor network 
    applications include monitoring of wildlife, pollution, bulding safety and 
    security, as well as supporting communications in disaster areas. They are 
    also expected to play an important role in the upcoming age of pervasive computing. 
    Due to the constraints in computation, memory, and power resources of sensors, 
    and the unique threats these networks must cope with, protecting it all is 
    both critical and a challenge. We will present some of the security problems 
    of sensor networks and show a few protocols that solve part of these problems.<br>
