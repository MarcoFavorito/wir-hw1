<p><b><font size="5" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Why are they so special?</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Positive systems have a long and rich history with
antecedents in the work of Markov, Perron and Frobenius, Leontieff
and Leslie, just to mention a few, but the unifying approach of
system theory was initiated by David Luenberger. In fact, as
explained in his textbook on dynamical systems, he firmly believed
that:<br>
<br>
<i>The theory of positive systems is deep and elegant -- and yet
pleasantly consistent with intuition. [...] Indeed, just the knowledge
that the system is positive allows one to make some fairly strong
statements about its behaviour; these statements being true no
matter what values the parameters may happen to take. It is for
positive systems, therefore, that dynamic systems theory assumes one
of its most potent forms.</i><br>
<br>
His intuition was so convincing that, from that time on, an impressive&nbsp;
number of theoretical contributions and applications to this field has appeared&nbsp;
in the literature. In fact, the modern approach to mathematical modeling is&nbsp;
based on two fundamental concepts: multidisciplinarity and model robustness.

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">As a matter of fact, positivity is a property arising in many disciplines and
David Luenberger envisaged model robustness in his statement regarding positive
systems reported above.<br>
<br>
To illustrate this point, it must be observed that, as well explained by Morris 
Hirsch<sup>1</sup>,
the most spectacular use of mathematics in science has been to predict
accurately and successfully observations regarding the Nature, such
as the motion of planets or the atomic structure. But, much of
science concerns not only predictions, but also understanding: How
galaxies form? How did species arises? How do economies develop?
Dynamical systems theory plays an important role in trying to answer
such questions, but its role is rather different from its more
familiar one as an exclusively predictive tool. Especially, as we
move away from physics toward the multidisciplinary world of the
biological and economical sciences or in general to the so-called
complex systems science, we find that dynamics is used more as a
source of “qualitative” insight than for making precise quantitative
predictions. Moreover, also the modern concept of prediction is more
flexible, as for the case of “scenario predictions”.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">In fact, mathematical models in biological and economical sciences are
conceptual models that may shine a clear light on certain tendencies
or relationships – not necessarily ``laws&quot; – that would otherwise remain
obscure. More importantly, for such conclusions to be convincing,
the mathematical deductions from the model must be robust –
i.e. insensitive to mathematical detail. This somewhat vague but
fundamental concept refers to the persistence of some specified
features of the mathematical system even in the presence
of perturbations. The magnitude and the nature of perturbations may&nbsp;
vary in different context, but the concept remains the same: the underlying
idea - that mathematical models should be robust in their
important feature - is widely accepted. In fact, in every
mathematical investigations the question will arise
on whether or not the results can be applied to the real world.</font></p>
