<H1>Description Logic framework for information integration</H1>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>Information Integration is one of the core problems in distributed
databases, cooperative information systems, and data warehousing, which are
key areas in the software development industry. Two critical factors for
the design and maintenance of applications requiring Information
Integration are conceptual modeling of the domain, and reasoning support
over the conceptual representation.  We demonstrate that Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning techniques can play an important role for both
of these factors, by proposing a Description Logic based framework for
Information Integration. We show that the development of successful
Information Integration solutions requires not only to resort to very
expressive Description Logics, but also to significantly extend them. We
present a novel approach to conceptual modeling for Information
Integration, which allows for suitably modeling the global concepts of the
application, the individual information sources, and the constraints among
different sources. Moreover, we devise inference procedures for the
fundamental reasoning services, namely relation and concept subsumption,
and query containment. Finally, we present a methodological framework for
Information Integration, which can be applied in several contexts, and
highlights the role of reasoning services within the design process. </P>
