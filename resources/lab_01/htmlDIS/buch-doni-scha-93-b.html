<i>Technical Report, DFKI</i><p>
Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems (TKRS) are tools for
designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages
(or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS
whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRS. The new
features studied, all of practical interest, can be summarized in three main
points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called
ALCN R   , including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and
role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between
general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we
prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like
satisfiability-, subsumption- and instance checking) through a sound, complete
and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCN R    -knowledge bases. Our
calculus extends the general technique of cs s and can be easily turned into a
procedure using exponential space. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also
the result that inclusion statements in ALCN R    can be simulated by
terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted.
