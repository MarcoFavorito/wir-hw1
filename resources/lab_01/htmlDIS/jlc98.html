<h1>A theory and implementation of cognitive mobile robots</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
We describe an approach to reasoning agents which is based on a formal
theory of actions and is actually implemented on a mobile robot working
in an office environment. From an epistemological viewpoint, our proposal
is originated by the correspondence between Dynamic Logics and Description
Logics. Specifically, we consider an epistemic extension of Description
Logics to provide a new theoretical framework for the representation of
dynamic systems, where the agent's reasoning is based on its knowledge
about the world. In this setting, we obtain a weaker notion of logical
inference, thus simplifying the reasoning task. From a practical viewpoint,
we use a general purpose knowledge representation system based on Description
Logics and its associated reasoning tools, in order to plan the actions of
the mobile robot ``Tino'', starting from the knowledge about the
environment and the action specification. In addition, we exploit the
robot's capabilities in order to integrate the execution of the plan with
reactive behaviors, thus enabling the agent to accomplish its tasks in the
real world.
