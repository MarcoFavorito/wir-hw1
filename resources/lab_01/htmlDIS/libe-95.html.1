Several methods are proposed, in the past years, to attempt to define how to
deal with a dynamic knowledge. From a computational point of view, different
definitions lead to different different computational property, namely to a
complexity between  p2to  p3in the polynomial hierarchy. Restricting the
analysis to cases in which some operations becomes tractable (Horn case),
other problems arises. We show that, providing some assumption on the
polynomial hierarchy, many update operators are uncompactable, i.e. it is
impossible to find a representation of the result without an exponential-size
explosion. We supply also the explicit representations of the updates for which
it is possible.
