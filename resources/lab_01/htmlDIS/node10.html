The current state of parallel and distributed computing is similar to
the state of sequential computing before the advent of LEDA and
similar platforms: a host of theoretically efficient algorithms is
known, but actually implementing these algorithms is exceedingly
time-consuming and error-prone because of the lack of software
packages for even the most basic tasks.  The situation is considerably
more complicated than in the sequential setting due to the many
radically different brands of parallel machines, and because the
younger field of parallel and distributed computing has had less time
to achieve a consensus on terminology and methodology.  We shall
initiate the development of a library for basic algorithms and data
structures for distributed memory machines and shall continue our work
on distributed systems simulation.
