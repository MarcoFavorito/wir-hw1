Call For Participation

International Workshop on Pattern Matching, Text Processing, and Compression

Venue: University of Warwick, UK.
Dates: Sunday, Dec 15 --- Thursday, Dec 19, 1996.

A current trend in computing is the interconnection of computers into a
global network. The utility and efficiency of such a network is critically
dependent on the techniques available for fast search, compression, image
searches and text processing over huge networked databases.

Some of the topics to be addressed in the workshop are: compression and
coding in information retrieval systems, string-matching with errors,
pattern-matching in digitised images, document analysis, information
retrieval from hypertext, parallel algorithms for string matching, tree
matching, and sequence searching in computational biology.

The participants will include people with interests in complexity and
algorithm analysis as well as those with practical experience in large scale
data processing. The invited talks will have a healthy tutorial component
and there will be ample time for collaborative discussions and research.

This meeting is funded in part by the British Council, the Israeli Ministry
of Science and EPSRC. Support for UK research students is available under
the EPSRC/LMS Mathfit programme.

Organisation and programme: The meeting will be at Warwick University,
hosted by the Department of Computer Science. Local arrangements will be
handled by Mike Paterson and Leslie Goldberg and global arrangements by Amir
Amihood (Bar-Ilan U., Israel), Costas Iliopoulos (King's College, London)
and S. Muthukrishnan (Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies).

Dissemination: The abstracts of the talks will be available on the web and
as a research report of the Department of Computer Science of the University
of Warwick.

Participation: There is no registration fee. The workshop is open to all
subject to availability of accommodation. Those who wish to participate must
contact <A HREF="mailto:msp@dcs.warwick.ac.uk">Mike Paterson</A>, <A HREF="mailto:leslie@dcs.warwick.ac.uk">Leslie Goldberg</A> or <A HREF="mailto:muthu@research.bell-labs.com">S. Muthukrishnan</A> as soon as
possible.

Accommodation: On the University of Warwick campus, there are good
comfortable rooms with en suite bathrooms. Prices for these are about 55
pounds ($88) for a full meals package. There are also cheaper rooms
available.

Location: The University of Warwick is located in Coventry which lies about
an hour and half by train to the northwest of London. The closest airport is
Birmingham, although it may be less expensive to fly to London and use the
excellent train service to Coventry. Neighouring towns such as Warwick,
Leamington Spa, Kenilworth, Stratford-upon-Avon, Birmingham, and in general,
the Midlands, offer a charming setting.
