<p>USARsim is a high fidelity game enting-based simulation of urban search and rescue (USAR) robots and environments intended as a research tool for the study of human-robot interaction (HRI) and multirobot coordination. USARsim is designed as a simulation companion to the National Institute of Standards (NIST) Referencence Test Facility for Autonomous Mobile Robots for Urban Search and Rescue. USARsim supports HRI by accurately rendering user interface elements (particularly camera video), accurately representing robot automation and behaviour, and accurately representing the remote environment that links the operator's awareness with the robot's behaviours. Because the simulation is built on top of a leading game engine it offers high quality graphics, a physics engine, and compatibility with commercial development and modeling tools. This constellation of features is not found in bespoke simulations. The current release consists of: environmental models (levels) of the NIST Yellow, Orange, and Red Arenas as well as a partially textured version of the Nike Silo reference environment, robot models of commercial and experimental robots, and sensor models. Simulation users are expected to supply user interfaces and automation and coordination logic. USARsim architecture and capabilities will be discussed and demonstrated. Issues affecting the use of USARsim in Robocup competition will be presented.</p>
