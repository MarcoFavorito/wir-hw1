The ability of Database Systems to cope with changing situations
and information coming from different sources is crucial for
their applicability in real-world scenarios.   Recent work in the
field of belief revision and update has provided us tecniques to
handle change.   In this paper we introduce a different form of
revision aiming at capturing the process of ``merging'' possibly
inconsistent pieces of information.   We call this process
arbitration.   Along the lines of Gardenfors' work, we propose a
set of postulates for this operator and prove a representation
theorem.
