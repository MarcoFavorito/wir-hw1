Knowing the position and orientation of a mobile robot situated in an
environment is a critical element for effectively accomplishing complex tasks
requiring autonomous navigation.  Techniques for robot self-localization have
been extensively studied in the past, but an effective general solution does not
exist, and it is often necessary to integrate different methods in order to
improve the overall result.  In this paper we present a self-localization method
that is based on the Hough Transform for matching a geometric reference map
with a representation of range information acquired by the robot's sensors.
The technique is adequate for indoor office-like environments, and specifically
for those environments that can be represented by a set of segments.  We have
implemented and successfully tested this method in the RoboCup environment
and we believe that it has been a good benchmark for its use in office-like
environments populated with unknown and moving obstacles (e.g. persons
moving around).
