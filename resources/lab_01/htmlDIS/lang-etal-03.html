Independence -- the study of what is relevant to a given problem
of reasoning -- has received an increasing attention from the AI
community.   In this paper, we consider two basic forms of
independence, namely, a syntactic one and a semantic one.   We
show features and drawbacks of them.   In particular, while the
syntactic form of independence is computationally easy to check,
there are cases in which things that intuitively are not relevant
are not recognized as such.   We also consider the problem of
forgetting, i.e., distilling from a knowledge base only the part
that is relevant to the set of queries constructed from a subset
of the alphabet.   While such process is computationally hard, it
allows for a simplification of subsequent reasoning, and can thus
be viewed as a form of compilation:   once the relevant part of a
knowledge base has been extracted, all reasoning tasks to be
performed can be simplified.
