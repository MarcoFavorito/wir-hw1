<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q1">Q1</A>: I've tried to use the &quot;mkmkfiles.imake&quot;
script to generate Makefiles so I can build GLUT, but it doesn't seem
to work. </P>
<P>
A1: While Imakefiles are supposted to be system independent (hence the
&quot;I&quot;), the commands to translate Imakefiles into Makefiles
varies from system to system. The X Consortium provides a command
called &quot;xmkmf&quot;, but vendors do not put this command in a
consistent place. The &quot;mkmkfiles.imake&quot; script tries its best
to generate Makefiles, but may get confused by different vendors
configurations that I am not aware of. </P>
<P>
It is also possible the imake configuration files (typically located at
/usr/lib/X11/config) are buggy or from a very old version of X. </P>
<P>
SGI users can benefit from using the &quot;mkmkfile.sgi&quot; script
that uses SGI's parallel make, though &quot;mkmkfiles.imake&quot;
should work too. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q2">Q2</A>: GLUT needs improved menus, dialog boxes,
scrollbars, text entry fields, etc. to be useful to me? </P>
<P>
A2: GLUT does not pretend to be a full-featured graphical user
interface toolkit. </P>
<P>
You _could_ write these sorts of GUI objects using GLUT and OpenGL if
you needed to. The other alternative is to use Motif or whatever full
featured toolkit you have. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q3">Q3</A>: What new things are in GLUT 3.0? </P>
<P>
A3: See README.glut3 or read The OpenGL Utility (GLUT) Programming
Interface document. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q4">Q4</A>: Is there a version of GLUT for Windows NT or
Windows 95. </P>
<P>
A4: Nate Robins and Layne Christensen at Evans &amp; Sutherland has
been working on a freely distributable version of <A
 HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~narobins/glut.html">GLUT for Windows 95
and NT</A> (<A HREF="http://rcru1.te.rl.ac.uk/~jab/opengl/">European
mirror</A>). His efforts are directed at porting GLUT 3.3.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q5">Q5</A>: Is there a version of GLUT for OS/2? </P>
<P>
A5: Yes. I believe a version based on GLUT 2.x is distributed on an
OS/2 OpenGL developer's CD-ROM. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q6">Q6</A>: Is there a version of GLUT for the Power Mcintosh? </P>
<P>
A6: Was told by Template Graphics that an incomplete version of GLUT
had been developed for their OpenGL product for the Power Mcintosh. I
am not sure if it was ever completed or made available. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q7">Q7</A>: I'm hesitant about upgrading to GLUT 3.0 since
I've got things working will with GLUT 2.3. Is the transition painful? </P>
<P>
A7: I do not believe so. There are two changes worth noting that _may_
affect programs you have written. </P>
<P>
First, you need a display callback registered before your display your
windows on the screen. It did not make sense for this to not be true.
In all likeihood, this should not affect your GLUT programs if they
written well. </P>
<P>
Second, you can no longer change, create, or destroy menus while pop-up
menus are in use. Before, you could do this, but it meant a menu might
be changed while in use. It was near impossible to describe what should
happen in the case of menus being changed while in use that was likely
to be portable to the way other window systems handled menus, so I made
the practice illegal. </P>
<P>
You can register a menu status callback to know when menus become used
and unused to avoid changing menus while they are in use. </P>
<P>
For more details about what has changed, see the CHANGES file. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q8">Q8</A>: So how do I use GLUT and Motif together? </P>
<P>
A8: You don't. To make GLUT simple and easy-to-program, GLUT supplies
its own event processing loop. This makes it nearly impossible to
combine GLUT and Motif. If you want Motif, you probably want a
full-featured toolkit, and you ship skip GLUT and implement your
application directly in Motif. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q9">Q9</A>: I have a bunch of simpe OpenGL programs using the
aux toolkit descibed in the OpenGL Programming Guide (the
&quot;red&quot; book). Is there an easy way to convert them to GLUT? </P>
<P>
A9: In the progs/redbook directory, there is a script named
aux2glut.sed It will give you a good start at converting simple aux
calls to their GLUT equivalents. It is a good start, but you'll still
have to hand edit some things. </P>
<P>
Here's a usage example: </P>
<P>
sed -f aux2glut.sed &lt; aux_prog. &gt; glut_prog.c </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q10">Q10</A>: I have IRIX 6.2 (or 6.1) and I'd like to write
GLUT programs run in true 64-bit and/or benefit from the recent, faster
MIPS processors. How do I build GLUT to support these newer application
binary interfaces (ABIs)? </P>
<P>
A10: See README.irix6 </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q11">Q11</A>: I'd like to write FORTRAN programs using GLUT
and OpenGL. How do I use GLUT with FORTRAN? </P>
<P>
A11: GLUT does have a FORTRAN language binding. </P>
<P>
For instructions for building a binding library for Silicon Graphics
workstations, see README.fortran </P>
<P>
If you want to use GLUT and OpenGL or Mesa on with Fortran on non-SGI
systems, I recommend that you check, William Mitchell's <A
 HREF="http://math.nist.gov/f90gl/">f90gl home page</A>.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q12">Q12</A>: I'd like to use the sophisticated input devices
that GLUT supports. What should I know about this? </P>
<P>
A12: GLUT uses the X Input extension to talk to these devices. Because
the X Input extension gives a framework for supporting input devices,
but does not manadate how particular devices are supported, it is
possible that each vendor supports the same input devices differently. </P>
<P>
GLUT as implemented supports SGI's means of advertising the tablet,
dial &amp; button box, and Spaceball devices. I am not sure how other
vendors support these devices. For the details of SGI's support for
these devices, see README.xinput Since there is no benefit in each
vendor supporting these same devices in a different an incompatible
way, I encourage other vendors to implement their devices in this same
manner. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q13">Q13</A>: Can I use GLUT and Open Inventor? </P>
<P>
A13: Yes. See the README.inventor file. Also, some source code examples
can be found at progs/inventor </P>
<P>
Because the Open Inventor development enviornment is not supported on
all systems, the Inventor example programs are not built by default,
and the Makefile there only support SGI systems. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q14">Q14</A>: I have Sun workstation, and it is supposed to
support overlays. So why does GLUT not use them? </P>
<P>
A14: GLUT uses the SERVER_OVERLAY_VISUALS convention that advertises
overlay visuals. Most major workstation vendors support this convention
(DEC, HP, IBM, SGI), but Sun does not. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q15">Q15</A>: The stroke font used for GLUT looks familar.
Where did it come from? </P>
<P>
A15: The data for the &quot;stroke roman&quot; font is lifted from the
X11R5 PEX sample implementation. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q16">Q16</A>: I read in the NOTICE file that you are writing a
book on programming OpenGL for the X Window System. When will it be
available? </P>
<P>
A16: At SIGGRAPH '96 or possibly before that. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q17">Q17</A>: You mention an unnamed bu &quot;very large
window system software vendor&quot; as the reason portable GLUT
programs should not directly include &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; and
&lt;GL/glu.h&gt; directly. What's the vendor and what are the details? </P>
<P>
A17: Microsoft. It's version of &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; requires
&lt;windows.h&gt; to be included before &lt;GL/gl.h&gt; can be included
because of Microsoft function declaration conventions. Sigh. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q18">Q18</A>: I want my GLUT program to read and send
information over a socket to some other program. How do I do this in in
GLUT? </P>
<P>
A18: You can not do it currently. I am considering such support for a
possible GLUT 4.0. I'd like to have a portable solution. </P>
<P>
What you'd like is a callback that would tell you when a socket is
ready for reading and writing. I'm hoping to find a way to support this
in an operating system independent manner. Does anyone know of a good
portable interface for networked bytestream connections? </P>
<P>
For now, you've got the source code to GLUT and you could hack it into
GLUT for whatever particular interface your operating system provides. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q19">Q19</A>: Where's the best place to ask questions about
GLUT or OpenGL? Can I just email them to you? </P>
<P>
A19: While I may try to return email if I have time, the best place is
the comp.graphics.api.opengl newsgroup. This gives a lot more people a
chance to answer your question and you'll probably get an answer much
faster than sending me email. Plus, I may not know the answer though
someone on the &quot;net&quot; may know it. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q20">Q20</A>: My workstation doesn't have OpenGL. Where can I
get a free copy to use with GLUT? </P>
<P>
A20: OpenGL is licensed by Silicon Graphics and is not available as
&quot;free&quot; or &quot;public domain&quot; software, but workstation
vendors typically bundle OpenGL software with their workstation.
However, there is a package called Mesa written by Brian Paul at the
University of Wisconsin that implements the OpenGL API. (To be branded
as &quot;OpenGL&quot;, an implementation must be licensed <I>and</I>
 pass the Architectural Review Board's conformance suite, so Mesa is
not an official &quot;OpenGL&quot; implementation.) Mesa does work with
GLUT. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q21">Q21</A>: I hear GLUT 3.0 has overlay support. Where is an
example? </P>
<P>
A21: Look at <B><TT>progs/examples/zoomdino.c</TT></B> for an example
of using overlays for rubber-banding and display of a help message,
both in the overlays. Also, <B><TT>test/over_test.c</TT></B> exercises
all of the overlay routines. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q22">Q22:</A> I get BadMatch X protocol errors when I run GLUT
programs. What gives?</P>
<P>
A22: There is a bug in the Solaris 2.4 and 2.5 implementation of <TT>XmuLookupStandardColormap</TT>
 (fixed in Solaris 2.6). When you compile GLUT on Solaris 2.4 or 2.5,
please apply the following patch and compile with <TT>-DSOLARIS_2_4_BUG</TT>
 to workaround the problem. To do this, edit the <TT>glut/lib/glut/Makefile</TT>
 and add <TT>-DSOLARIS_2_4_BUG</TT> to the <TT>CFLAGS</TT> macro. See
the comment in the patch below. This code is already in GLUT 3.1 and
later.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="Q23">Q23:</A> What is new in GLUT 3.1?</P>
<P>
A23: GLUT 3.1 is largely a maintence release. There are some new
programs, a few minor GLUT library bug fixes, but mostly GLUT 3.1 is to
make sure GLUT builds cleanly on various platforms like SunOS, HP/UX,
Solaris, and Linux. See the CHANGES file included in the distribution
for more details.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q24">Q24:</A> How do I make Linux shared libraries for GLUT?</P>
<P>
A24: Peter F. Martone (<A HREF="mailto:pmarton@mailbox.bgsu.edu">pmarton@mailbox.bgsu.edu</A>)
has written some instructions for making a Linux shared library for
GLUT. You can grab the instructions for doing so from <A
 HREF="http://pizza.bgsu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~pmarton/makeMainIndex">http://pizza.bgsu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~pmarton/makeMainIndex</A></P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q25">Q25:</A> New in GLUT 3.2.</P>
<P>
A25: Like GLUT 3.1, GLUT 3.2 is a maintence release. Along with bug
fixes to the core GLUT library, many new GLUT example programs have
been added. The portability of the examples has been improved so that
most should build using Windows 95 and NT. Also, GLUT API man pages are
now included. See the CHANGES file included in the distribution for
more details.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q26">Q26:</A> GLUT API man pages.</P>
<P>
A26: Please see the README.man file for details. The easiest way for
SGI users to get the man pages is to install the
&quot;glut_dev.man.glut&quot; subsystem included with the pre-compiled
SGI GLUT images.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q27">Q27:</A> Fast window repair for Mesa.</P>
<P>
A27: The GLX specification states that the state of a window's back
color buffer after a glXSwapBuffers is undefined. However, the freeware
Mesa implementation of the OpenGL API always leaves the back buffer
with its previous contents (ie, it simply &quot;copies&quot; the back
buffer contents to the front buffer).</P>
<P>
Because Mesa lacks hardware acceleration and is often slow to redraw a
window, this presents the opportunity to speed redrawing a window
damaged by window system interactions by simply calling glXSwapBuffers
again.</P>
<P>
If you set the MESA_SWAP_HACK enviornment variable, GLUT 3.2 will try
to repair double buffered windows not otherwise needing a redisplay
because of glutPostRedisplay by calling glXSwapBuffers when Mesa is the
OpenGL implementation being used and the last display callback called
glutSwapBuffers.</P>
<P>
In general, this means if you see MESA_SWAP_HACK when using Mesa,
double buffered GLUT programs will redraw very quickly after being
damaged but still operate well if they've been correctly written to use
glutPostRedisplay to trigger application required redraws.</P>
<P>
I encourage all Mesa users to set the MESA_SWAP_HACK environment
variable.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q28">Q28:</A> Advanced GLUT example .rgb image file.</P>
<P>
A28: Yes, the image files these examples use are large and were
seperated out from the main GLUT source code distribution. Get the
glut_data.tar.gz file from where you got your GLUT distribution. Untar
these data files over your glut distribution so the &quot;data&quot;
directory is at the same level as &quot;progs&quot;. Then do a
&quot;make links&quot; in the progs/advanced directory to make symbolic
links.</P>
<P>
See the progs/advanced/README file for more details.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="29">Q29:</A> Why doesn't GLUT programs compiled on IRIX 6.4 or
6.3 work earlier releases?</P>
<P>
A29: First, SGI never guarantees that an executable built on a later
IRIX release will work on an earlier release. Sometimes it works; more
often than not it does not. GLUT takes advantage of a new X
optimization in IRIX 6.3 called &quot;fast atoms&quot;. This
optimization lets X clients determine common atom values without an X
server round-trip. This helps X performance.</P>
<P>
If you compile the GLUT library on an IRIX 6.3 or IRIX 6.4 machine, the
library will support fast atoms. This will mean that if you run
executables linked against the &quot;fast atom enabled&quot; version of
the GLUT library, you'll get a run-time link error saying something
like:</P>
<P>
<TT>17062:glut_example: rld: Fatal Error: attemped access to
unresolvable symbol in projtex: _XSGIFastInternAtom</TT></P>
<P>
Do not be alarmed. If you want, you can recompile the GLUT library with
the <TT>-DNO_FAST_ATOMS a</TT>nd get a version of the library that
doesn't have the support so that GLUT executables built with a library
compiled without &quot;fast atoms&quot; can work on earlier IRIX
releases. <I>Note that even if you do compile with <TT>-DNO_FAST_ATOMS</TT>,
there is still no guarantee that an IRIX executable compiled on a newer
release will actually work on an older release (but at least you'll
have a chance!).</I></P>
<P>
Note that the precompiled images lack &quot;fast atoms&quot; support so
they will work fine with IRIX releases before IRIX 6.3 and 6.4.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q30">Q30:</A> Can I get a version of GLUT for the Power
Macintosh?</P>
<P>
A30: Probably pretty soon. Conix Graphics is working on a port of GLUT
3.2 as of late January 1997. Try checking the Conix Graphics web site <A
 HREF="http://www.conix3d.com">http://www.conix3d.com</A> for current
info.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q31">Q31</A>: What is new in GLUT 3.4?</P>
<P>
A31: GLUT 3.4 is an incremental release. An Ada binding for SGI
machines is included along with an Ada example. Many new sample
programs. Several such as dinoshade.c demonstrate real-time rendering
techniques relevant for games. Examples using Sam Leffler's libtiff
library for loading, drawing and writing TIFF image files. GLUT version
of the facial animation &quot;geoview&quot; decibed in the Parke and
Water's book &quot;Computer Facial Animation&quot;. New API interfaces
to be made part of the GLUT 4 API update (not yet fully finalized
though). glutInitDisplayMode for example. Improved portability and a
few bug fixes.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q32">Q32: </A>I installed SGI's Cosmo3D beta and GLUT, and I'm
having problems compiling GLUT programs.</P>
<P>
A32: Unfortunately, SGI's Cosmo3D beta images install a DSO for GLUT
(libglut.so) that does not fully implement the GLUT API and lacks some
of the newer GLUT 3.4 entrypoints as well. The problem is that a DSO
takes preferenc over an archive when you compile with an option like
&quot;-lglut&quot;. While the Cosmo3D beta installs a libglut.so, my
GLUT distribution and images only build and install an archive. There
are a couple of solutions:</P>
<OL>
    <LI>
    Explicitly link your GLUT programs with libglut.a (the archive version
    of GLUT). For example, put &quot;/usr/lib/libglut.a&quot; on your
    compile line instead of &quot;-lglut&quot;.<BR>

    <LI>
    You can convert the GLUT 3.4 archive into a DSO:
    <PRE>
su
cd /usr/lib
mv libglut.so libglut.so.cosmo
cc -32 -o libglut.so -shared -all libglut.a
cd /usr/lib32
mv libglut.so libglut.so.cosmo
cc -n32 -o libglut.so -shared -all libglut.a

</PRE>
    <P>
    The new DSO generated from the GLUT 3.4 DSO should be compatible with
    the old Cosmo version. This will mean that all the GLUT programs you
    build will need the libglut.so on the machine they run on.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <LI>
    Remove the Cosmo3D beta.
</OL>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q33">Q33:</A> What is new in GLUT 3.5?</P>
<P>
A33: The most significant change with GLUT 3.5 is unifying the X Window
System and Win32 versions of GLUT into a single source code
distribution. Henk Kok contributed several cool new demos
(rollercoaster, chess, opengl_logo). All the demos build cleanly under
Win32. Lots of bug fixes. Interesting new OpenGL rendering techniques
are demonstrated in a number of new examples: movelight, dinoshade,
halomagic, rendereps, movelight, shadowfun, torus_test, underwater,
texfont, reflectdino.</P>

<A NAME="Q34">Q34:</A> How do I use the precompiled Win32 GLUT DLLs
with Borland compilers?</P>
<P>
A34: The &quot;implib&quot; command should let you generate a <TT>GLUT.LIB</TT>
 that works with Borland compilers from the precompiled <TT>GLUT.DLL</TT>
 Here is an example:</P>
<PRE>
  C:\&gt;implib C:\GLUT\LIB\GLUT.LIB C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\GLUT.DLL
</PRE>
<P>
After this, then link <TT>C:\GLUT\LIB\GLUT.LIB</TT> to your project</P>

<A NAME="Q35">Q35:</A> Are there any C++ wrappers for GLUT?</P>

A35: Yes, <A HREF="http://www.duke.edu/~stetten/">George Stetten</A> (<A
 HREF="mailto:stetten@acpub.duke.edu">stetten@acpub.duke.edu</A>) of
Duke University has made available the GlutMaster C++ wrapper classes.

<A NAME="Q36">Q36:</A> How do you avoid the Console window appearing
when you compiler a Win32 GLUT application with Microsoft compilers?</P>
<P>
A36: Try using the following Microsoft Visual C compiler flags:</P>
<PRE>
   /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /ENTRY:mainCRTStartup
</PRE>
<P>
These are linker options... if main or wmain are defined, MSVC build a
CONSOLE app by default; hence the need for /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS. if
/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS is defined, MSVC expects WinMain or wWinMain to be
defined; hence the need to /ENTRY:mainCRTStartup (eg the entry point is
the usual C main).</P>
<P>
stdout/stderr are [apparently] not &quot;attached&quot;; output via
printf is simply &quot;eaten&quot; unless redirected at the
command-line or by a parent program.</P>

<A NAME="Q37">Q37:</A> What is new in GLUT 3.6?</P>
<P>
A37: GLUT 3.6 adds/improves the following:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    Win32 GLUT performance improvements.<BR>

    <LI>
    Win32 GLUT confromance improvements.<BR>

    <LI>
    <A HREF="http://linas.org/">Linas Vepstas's</A> <A
     HREF="http://linas.org/gle/index.html">GLE Tubing &amp; Extrusions
    Library</A> is included with GLUT, including nroff man pages and
    demo programs.<BR>

    <LI>
    More GLUT-based OpenGL demos and examples (and bug fixes to existing
    demos and examples).<BR>

    <LI>
    glutPostWindowRedisplay and glutPostWindowOverlayRedisplay entry points
    added for posting redisplays on non-current windows (for faster
    multi-window updates).<BR>

<A NAME="Q38">Q38:</A> On my IRIX 6.3 SGI O2 workstation, why do I get
errors about &quot;glXChannelRectSyncSGIX&quot; being unresolved
building certain GLUT examples?</P>
<P>
A38: The original IRIX 6.3 release for the O2 workstation accidently
advertised support for the dynamic video resize extension supported on
SGI's high-end InfiniteReality graphics system. This confuses GLUT into
providing its dynamic video resize sub-API.</P>
<P>
This problem is fixed by patch 1979 (and its successor patches).
Because patch 1979 (and its successor patches) also help O2's OpenGL
rendering performance, I strongly recommend requesting the latest O2
OpenGL patch from SGI customer support.</P>
<P>
Once the patch is installed, your build errors will be resolved.</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q39">Q39:</A> Using GLUT with Microsoft OpenGL 1.1 and compiling
GLUT with Borland compilers causes GLUT applications to generates floating
point exceptions. What can be done?</P>
<P>
A39: Under certain conditions (e.g. while rendering solid surfaces with
lighting enabled) MS libraries cause some illegal operations like
floating point overflow or division by zero. The default behaviour of
Microsoft compilers is to mask (ignore) floating point exceptions, while
Borland compilers do not. A function of Borland run-time library allows
to mask exceptions. Modify glut_init.c by adding the following lines to
the function __glutOpenWin32Connection:</P>
<PRE>
#ifdef __BORLANDC__
#include <float.h>
  _control87(MCW_EM,MCW_EM);
#endif
</PRE>
<P>
With this modification, compiling the GLUT library with your Borland
compilers and using GLUT with Microsoft OpenGL should work fine.</P>
<P>
GLUT 3.7 will have this change already included in the GLUT library
source code distribution.</P>
<P>
This advice comes from Pier Giorgio Esposito (mc2172@mclink.it).</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q40">Q40:</A> Using GLUT with SGI OpenGL for Windows and
compiling with Borland compilers results in linking problems. What can
be done?</P>
<P>
A40: Some care must be taken when linking GLUT.DLL or programs that use
it with Borland compilers. The import library IMPORT32.LIB already
contains the functions exported by the Microsoft OpenGL libraries, thus
SGI OpenGL import libraries must be listed _before_ import32 in the
Borland tlink command line.</P>
<P>
This advice comes from Pier Giorgio Esposito (mc2172@mclink.it).</P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="Q41">Q41:</A>What is GameGLUT?</P>
<P>
A41: GameGLUT is a set of API extension to GLUT to be released in GLUT
3.7. These extensions provide keyboard release callbacks, disabling of
keyboard auto repeat, joystick callbacks, and full screen resolution
setting.</P>
