<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
In this talk I will present a short survey on recent (over the past
5-6 years) work on the analysis of packet switching networks without
probabilistic assumptions on the behavior of the traffic.  This line
of work was initiated by Borodin et al. in 1996, in a paper titled
``adversarial queuing theory''.<br>

More precisely, work in this area attempts to analyze the sizes of
buffers and the delays of packets in a packet-switching network, when
no probabilistic assumptions are known, or assumed, on the injection
of the packets into the network.  Rather, the injection of packets is
modeled as done by an adversary.<br>

The talk will present the model, the formulation of the adversary, and
some older and new results in this area.
