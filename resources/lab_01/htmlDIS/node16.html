The efficiency of many algorithms and data structures relies on the
exploitation of properties of combinatorial structures known to occur
with a high probability.  Our objective is to develop systematic
methods for predicting the average-case or probabilistic behaviour of
complex combinatorial objects, such as those arising in the ALCOM-IT 
project.  First, we shall study the critical parameters of random
combinatorial structures which determine performance.  Random graphs,
dynamic graphs, and circuits are directly relevant to models of
computation as well as to the analysis of optimisation algorithms and
distributed systems.  Random trees and random strings will be applied
to problems in stringology, distributed computing, general data
structures for searching, packet routing, on-line algorithms, etc.
Research on random logical formulae provides useful insight for hard
combinatorial problems.  Second, we shall systematise the theory of
`decomposable' models of randomness, with the goal of characterising
classes of problems that are decidable. This is closely intertwined
with computer algebra that provides the proper implementation
framework. We shall develop the <b> LUO</b> system by redesigning it
within Maple, structuring it into modules that can be used
separately. The goal is to develop a coherent collection of algorithms
and libraries, for simulating complex combinatorial models, for
explicitly solving recurrences, and for asymptotic analysis. A major
emphasis will be on robust methods with guaranteed correctness, based
on mixed numeric-symbolic algorithms for efficiency.  The programs
will then be usable for the exact analysis of large models (e.g.,
large finite state models) providing precise estimates of implied
constants and asymptotic convergence rates.
