  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unsolicited commercial electronic 
    mail, commonly referred to as spam, has continued to wreak havoc with electronic 
    communication. Such email consumes significant bandwidth, users' productivity, 
    and disk space. Several solutions have been proposed to eliminate spam in 
    the last few years. We broaden the definition of spam as any email unwanted 
    by the intended recipient. We propose a novel scalable scheme that aims to 
    add monetary cost to senders of such unwanted mail while allowing legitimate 
    mail to be exchanged at no cost to users and in the same manner as today. 
    Our scheme is entirely complementary to the large number of receiver-based 
    filtering ideas in use today. We describe our scheme, describe how it can 
    be integrated into the existing Internet email infrastructure, and discuss 
    our prototype implementation. Our scheme will neither outlaw spam, nor make 
    it obsolete; however it will add monetary cost only to spammers thereby increasing 
    the potential of lowering the frequency and amount of spam. </font></P>
