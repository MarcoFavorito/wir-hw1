Nonmonotonic logic is a well developed research area gathering the logical
formalisms that handle commonsense reasoning. One of the central issue in
the area is to establish a notion of nonmonotonic provability, which is usually
characterized via some modal logic. In [? ] a clear paradigm has been proposed
that classifies modal monotonic logics, augmented with the "negation by
failure" to prove rule. It turns out that it is not the only one. In this paper we
propose different paradigms for formalizing the notion of nonmonotonic
provability. We present a fixed point construction allowing the interpretation
of the necessity modal operator as a nonmonotonic provability operator
analogously to that used in the modal logic of provability for Peano
Arithmetic. We show that it faithfully interprets both default and
autoepistemic logics and we highlight its connections with the standard fixed
point construction &agrave; la McDermott and Doyle. This new paradigm
provides a different perspective in the classification of modal nonmonotonic
logics.
