<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Research Report 1995</H2>

Algorithmic Engineering is mainly concerned with the study of the intrinsic
complexity of problems, the design of algorithmic techniques for their
efficient solution and the test of such techniques in real-world situations.
<P>
In this area the research work at DIS in 1995 was carried on in the 
following directions:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#APPROXIMATION">approximate solution of NP-hard combinatorial problems</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#GRAPHS">graph and combinatorial algorithms</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#GEOMETRY">computational geometry and spatial data management</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#ON-LINE">on-line algorithms</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#DISTRIBUTED">distributed and network algorithms</A>,
<LI><A HREF="#LEARNING">computational learning theory</A>.
</UL>

<H3>1.<T><A NAME="APPROXIMATION">Approximate solution of NP-hard optimization problems</A></H3>

Due to their intrinsic complexity, for NP-hard optimization problems we 
cannot hope to find efficient 
general solution algorithms and we need to restrict ourselves to 
approximate solutions. Hence, the study 
of approximate algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems has a 
considerable importance both from 
the theoretical point of view and with respect to the practical aim of 
designing efficient approximation 
algorithms which are guaranteed to provide a solution within a maximum 
relative error.
<P>
In this area two research directions are pursued.
<P>
Along the first direction theoretical aspects of approximability have been 
studied. In particular a survey 
of the main research results in the characterization of approximable 
problems has been published [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-5">I2-5</A>] 
and research on the class of problems that can be efficiently approximated 
by means of local search 
algorithms has been continued [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-8">I2-8</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-9">I2-9</A>]. Besides, the study of more powerful 
local search 
approximation techniques, that generalize the standard technique and 
enlarge the power of this general 
paradigm, have been developed [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-1">I2-1</A>].
<P>
Along the second line, approximation algorithms have been designed for 
specific combinatorial 
problems. Namely in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-2">I2-2</A>] local search 
approximate heuristics for several colorability problems for 
undirected and directed hypergraphs, that are generalization of many well 
known NP-hard optimization 
problems, such as Max Cut, Max Directed Cut, and Set Splitting, have been 
proposed.
<P>
Successively [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-41">I2-41</A>] the minimum 
independent dominating set problem in bounded degree graphs has 
been studied, and approximate algorithms based on greedy and local search 
techniques has been 
developed.

<H3>2.<T><A NAME="GRAPHS">Graph and Combinatorial Algorithms</A></H3>

In this area the research has been focusing on dynamic graph algorithms, 
dynamic hypergraph 
algorithms, graph drawing and algorithmic techniques for several 
combinatorial problems. 
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-33">I2-33</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-40">I2-40</A>] the authors consider the problem of 
updating a single source shortest path tree in either a 
directed or an undirected graph, with positive real edge weights. The 
proposed semidynamic algorithms 
for the incremental problem (handling edge insertions and cost decrements) 
work for any graph, but 
their performances depend on the class of the considered graph. In any 
case the algorithms have 
optimal space requirements and query time. The cost of updates is computed 
in terms of amortized 
complexity and depends on the size of the output modifications. In the 
case of graphs with bounded 
genus, or bounded arboricity graphs, the incremental algorithm requires 
O(log n) amortized time per 
vertex update. For general graphs with n vertices and m edges our 
incremental solution requires O(m 
log n) amortized time per vertex update. The decremental problem for 
planar graphs is also considered, 
providing algorithms and data structures with analogous performances. 
<P>
This approach is further extended in [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-34">I2-34</A>] to deal with fully dynamic sequences 
of updates in general 
graphs. The cost of update operations depends on the class of the 
considered graph and on the number 
of vertices that, due to an edge modification, either change their 
distance from the source or change 
their parent in the shortest path tree. In the case of graphs with bounded 
genus (including planar 
graphs), bounded degree graphs, bounded treewidth graphs and B-near-planar 
graphs with bounded B, 
the update procedures require O(log n) amortized time per vertex update, 
while for general graphs with 
n vertices and m edges they require O(m log n) amortized time per vertex 
update.
Experimental tests show 
considerable advantages of this approach over the basic Dijkstra's 
algorithm.
<P>
Average case analysis of dynamic algorithms for fully dynamic connectivity 
for directed graphs has 
been considered in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-4">I2-4</A>].
<P>
Dynamic algorithms for the on-line maintenance of weighted hypergraphs 
have been devised with 
application to satisfiability of propositional Horn formulae with 
uncertainty in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-7">I2-7</A>], where the authors 
show how to represent a significant class of formulae by weighted directed 
hypergraphs and present two 
algorithms that solve the on-line Horn-SAT problem and find a minimum 
model for the formula 
working on the dynamic weighted hypergraph representation. These 
algorithms make increasing 
assumptions on the formula and the second one solves the on-line Horn-SAT 
problem with a total time 
linear in the size of the formula, matching the optimal result for Boolean 
Horn formulae.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-42">I2-42</A>] algorithms for deciding 
properties of Petri nets that make use of an a hypergraph-based 
approach have been presented. Namely the proposed algorithms allow to 
decide liveness and 
boundedness of the net, and to dynamically maintain the set of potentially 
firabile transitions for 
conflict-free Petri nets and the wider classes of 
series-parallel-conflict-free and series-parallel-
nondeterministic-conflict-free Petri nets.
<P>
The problem of automatically drawing a graph is a classical research 
theme. Dynamic graph drawing 
problems are studied in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-18">I2-18</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-24">I2-24</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-25">I2-25</A>] for planar graphs, trees and convex 
planar graphs. 
Combinatorial properties of triangular planar graphs are investigated in 
[<A HREF="report95.html#I2-26">I2-26</A>]. Proximity problems are 
analyzed in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-23">I2-23</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-36">I2-36</A>]. Upward planarity testing for single 
source acyclic digraphs is studied in [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-15">I2-15</A>].
Experimental studies comparing general-purpose graph drawing algorithms 
are carried out in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-21">I2-21</A>].
Other graph drawing issues are analyzed in [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-14">I2-14</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-17">I2-17</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-22">I2-22</A>].
<P>
Regarding the study of algorithmic techniques for combinatorial problems, 
in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-45">I2-45</A>] a characterization 
of a DFS-forest on directed graphs is proposed in terms of a relaxed 
planar embedding of its structure. 
An algorithm, based on that characterization, is proposed in order to 
maintain a DFS-forest in a directed 
acyclic graph with n nodes and m edges, achieving O(nm) total time in the 
worst case for any sequence 
of arc insertions, that is O(n) amortized time per arc insertion in a 
sequence of m such operations. This 
favourably compares with the time required to recompute DFS from scratch 
by using Tarjan's O(n+m) 
algorithm. Although this problem was pointed out almost a decade ago, this 
is the first algorithm for 
dynamic DFS for nontrivial classes of graphs.
<P>
A topological order of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph G=(V, E) 
is any total order ORD such 
that if (x, y) is in E, then x precedes y in ORD. In [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-46">I2-46</A>] the authors consider the dynamic 
version of 
this problem, and provide simple algorithms and data structures achieving 
O(n) amortized time per 
edge insertion starting from an empty graph, which favourably compares to 
the trivial O(m+n) time 
bound per operation obtained applying the off-line algorithm. The 
additional space requirement, beside 
the representation of the graph itself, is O(n). Experimental results show 
that our algorithm performs in 
practice orders of magnitude faster than the off-line algorithm.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-39">I2-39</A>] an implicit data structure 
for partial lattice representation is presented, which allows to test 
partial order relation among two given elements in constant time. The data 
structure proposed has an 
overall O(n sqrt(n))-space complexity, where n is the element set size. 
This data structure is extended in 
[<A HREF="report95.html#I2-47">I2-47</A>] for supporting new operations.

<H3>3. <T><A NAME="GEOMETRY">Computational geometry and spatial data management</A></H3>

In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-20">I2-20</A>] new results on balanced cuts 
of hyperrectangles in d-space are presented, and trade-offs 
between balance and size are investigated.
<P>
The hive graph is a rectangular graph, introduced by Chazelle, satisfying 
some additional condition 
widely used in computational geometry for solving several kinds of 
fundamental queries. In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-19">I2-19</A>] an 
algorithm for incrementally building a hive graph structure is given; 
while it retains the same optimal 
performance in query answering, it also allows to incrementally insert new 
line segments optimal time. 
A temporal database application of our results is given.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-13">I2-13</A>] the authors face the problem 
of computing an enclosing pair of axis-parallel rectangles of a 
set of polygonal objects in the plane, serving as a simple container.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-43">I2-43</A>] it is shown that bounded 
spherical orders, i.e. orders with a single minimum and a single 
maximum and whose Hasse diagram h as a crossing free upward drawing on a 
sphere, have Boolean 
dimension never greater than 4, and not greater than 5 in the case the 
poset has more than one maximal 
element, but only one minimum. These results are obtained by a 
characterization of spherical orders in 
terms of containment between circular arcs. Since the transitive closure 
of a directed acyclic graph is 
always described by a partial order, this result gives a constant time 
reachability testing algorithm for 
an extension of the class of s-t dags.

<H3>4.<T><A NAME="ON-LINE">On line algorithms</A></H3>

On-line problems require to satisfy each request in a sequence without 
knowledge of future requests. 
The goal is to serve efficiently the entire sequence of requests. In [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-35">I2-35</A>] a general method for on-line 
resource management based on Linear Programming is given. In the paper 
optimal algorithms for two 
problems are presented: a) cost problems, where we want to satisfy a 
sequence of resource requests 
using the minimal amount of resources; b) benefit problems, where we want 
to assign a set available 
resources to a sequence of resource requests in order to obtain the 
maximum profit. This method can be 
used to model a large class of situations. An example of application is 
the virtual circuit routing 
problem where each transmission can use only part of the available 
bandwidth on each edge can be 
modelled as an on-line resource management problem. In [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-11">I2-11</A>] it is shown that no efficient 
on-line 
algorithm exists for the general case, when a single transmission may 
occupy the whole bandwidth of 
an edge; this is true even if randomization of preemption techniques are 
used. This result is used to 
show that some problems arising in optical fiber networks have no 
efficient algorithms.
<P>
The method proposed in [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-35">I2-35</A>] can also 
be used to optimally solve the multiprocessor scheduling 
problem where jobs have different completion times on different 
processors. The other setting, where 
jobs have the same completion time on all processors, is studied in [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-12">I2-12</A>] with the additional 
constraint that each job can be either accepted or rejected at the expense 
of some penalty; Optimal 
algorithms are given when the goal is to minimize the maximal completion 
time of accepted jobs plus 
the total penalty for rejected jobs. 
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-10">I2-10</A>] the problem of deciding when 
to invest capital to buy new machinery that allows to produce 
with less cost is studied. Here the goal is to minimize the global 
production cost and the capital 
investments used to improve the production.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-6">I2-6</A>] the problem of scheduling a 
server in a metric space as to cover a set of requests given in on-
line fashion has been considered, with the constraint that the server has 
to return to the origin when the 
sequence of requests terminates. For sake of intuition the problem has 
been called On-line Travelling 
Salesman Problem. Competitive algorithms that update efficiently the route 
of the server when new 
requests are presented have been proposed for various metric spaces and 
more powerful specific results 
have been achieved in the case of the real line.
<P>
The problem of scheduling broadcast transmissions in packet radio networks 
using a TDMA (Time 
Division Multiple Access) protocol has been shown in [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-16">I2-16</A>] to be intractable. Furthermore 
distributed 
algorithms are proposed which has been sperimentally tested as giving 
near-optimal solutions.

<H3>5.<T><A NAME="DISTRIBUTED">Distributed and network algorithms</A></H3>

In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-29">I2-29</A>], the problem of routing 
messages along shortest paths in a distributed network without using 
complete routing tables is considered. In particular, the complexity of 
deriving minimum (in terms of 
number of intervals) Interval Routing Schemes is analyzed under different 
requirements.
<P>
Several methods exist for routing messages in a network without using 
complete routing tables 
(compact routing). In k-interval routing schemes (k-IRS), links carry up 
to k intervals each. A message 
is routed over certain link if its destination belongs to one of the 
intervals of the link. In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-32">I2-32</A>] some 
results for the necessary value of k in order to achieve shortest path 
routing are given. Even though for 
very structured networks low values of k suffice, it is shown that for 
'general graphs' interval routing 
cannot significantly reduce the space-requirements for shortest path 
routing. In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-30">I2-30</A>] an extension of 
the Interval Routing Scheme k-IRS to the multi-dimensional case kd is 
introduced.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-27">I2-27</A>] the attention is focused on 
deadlock avoidance methods for routing messages in parallel and 
distributed networks. In particular, the concept of systolic acyclic 
orientation is introduced.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-44">I2-44</A>] the computational complexity 
of finding (off and on-line) minimum packet routing schemes 
is studied, both in terms of end-to-end delay and of completion time. In 
particular the authors first show 
that, in both cases, it is not possible to find optimal schemes and, then 
prove the hardness of 
approximating the minimum end-to-end delay in polynomial time. Next, it is 
shown that polynomial 
time approximation schemes (PTAS) cannot exist for the minimum completion 
time problem, and some 
approximation algorithms are given.
<P>
In this area the distributed computation in totally synchronous 
distributed network is also studied; that 
is synchronous system for which the simmetry breaking problem is 
unsolvable, and then it is not 
possible to elect a leader and centralize the computation. In [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-3">I2-3</A>] the problem of finding the extrema in 
a distributed multiset is considered, that is of determining the minimum 
and the maximum value of a 
multiset whose elements are drawn from a totally ordered universe and 
stored at the entity of a ring 
network.
<P>
In [<A HREF="report95.html#I2-28">I2-28</A>] the authors investigate the 
existence of efficient algorithms to arbitrate access of clients in a 
distributed network to a shared resource by using a token-passing 
strategy. In particular the setting is 
considered where network topology is a one-directional ring and requests 
are anonymous.

<H3>6.<T><A NAME="LEARNING">Computational learning theory</A></H3>

Diagnostic problem-solving gives rise to sequential reasoning processes 
facing the trade-off between 
the plausibility of the best explanation of an evidence set that can be 
extended incrementally and the 
cost associated with its observation. In [<A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-37">I2-37</A>, <A 
HREF="report95.html#I2-38">I2-38</A>] a formal model is presented that 
manages such 
processes in the real case in which it is not possible to define a priori 
well-founded stopping criterion. 
The diagnostic problem is structured and managed on a Bayesian belief 
network.
