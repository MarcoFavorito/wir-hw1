  We present a prototype of the Italian version of WordNet, a general
  computational lexical resource. Some relevant extensions are discussed
  tomake it usable for parsing: in particular we add verbal selectional
  restrictions to make lexical discrimination effective. Italian WordNet has
  been coupled with a parser and a number of experiments have been
  performed to individuate the methodology with the best trade-off between
  disambiguation rate and precision. Results confirm intuitive hypothesis on
  the role of selectional restrictions and show evidences for a WordNet-like
  organization of lexical senses.
