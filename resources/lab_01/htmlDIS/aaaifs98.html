Reasoning on high-level robot behaviors by model checking and local validity
tests</H1>
G. De Giacomo and R. Rosati

Abstract</H2>
In this paper we explore a research direction in reasoning about actions
stemming from the Robot-Tino Project at the University of Rome.&nbsp; We
introduce a logical formalism that combines a very expressive logic of
programs, the modal mu-calculus, with a special use of a minimal knowledge
operator.&nbsp; Reasoning in such formalism can be done by integrating
model checking for modal mu-calculus and propositional inference.&nbsp;
This allows for exploiting existing model checking techniques and systems
for reasoning about complex high-level robot behaviors, without renouncing
to deal with incomplete information on the initial state and both the preconditions
and the effects of actions.
