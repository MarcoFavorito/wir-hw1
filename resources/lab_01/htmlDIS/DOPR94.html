                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>A  universe  composed by rational ground terms is characterized (both constructively and axiomatically), where the interpreted set constructs ue
                   and with   (the latter designating the element insertion operation)
                   coexist with free Herbrand functors. Ordinary syntactic equivalence must be superseded by an equivalence relation  , between
                   trees labelled over a signature, that suitably reflects the semantics
                   of with  . Membership (definable as "d 2 tdef As( t with  d )     t")
                   meets the non-well-foundedness property characteristic of hyperset theory. An algorithm for solving the NP-complete unification
                   problem  pertaining  to  hollow  hyperset  terms  is  provided,  and
                   shown to be totally correct. An application to the matching of
                   finite state automata is hinted at.<p>
