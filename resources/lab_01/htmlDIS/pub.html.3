general nonholonomic systems with an application to the plate-ball
mechanism," to appear in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 21, no. 2, 2005 (<a href="../../pub/papers/TRO04.pdf">pdf</a>).</li>

<br><br>We present a framework for the stabilization of nonholonomic systems
that do not possess special properties such as flatness or exact
nilpotentizability. Our approach makes use of two tools: an
iterative control scheme and a nilpotent approximation of the system
dynamics. The latter is used to compute an
approximate steering control which, repeatedly applied to the system,
guarantees asymptotic stability with exponential
convergence to any desired set-point, under appropriate conditions. For
illustration, we apply the proposed strategy to design a
stabilizing controller for the plate-ball manipulation system, a
canonical example of non-flat nonholonomic mechanism. The theoretical
performance and robustness of the algorithm are confirmed by
simulations, both in the nominal case and in the presence of a
perturbation on the ball radius.

approximations for nonholonomic systems with singularities," IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control<font face="Times New Roman">,

<br><br>Nilpotent approximations are a useful tool for analyzing and controlling
systems whose tangent linearization does not preserve controllability,
such as nonholonomic mechanisms. However conventional homogeneous approximations
exhibit a drawback: in the neighborhood o singular points (where the system
growth vector is not constant) the vector fields of the approximate dynamics
do not vary continuously with the approximation point. The geometric counterpart
of this situation is that the sub-Riemannian distance estimate provided
by the classical Ball-Box Theoremis not uniform at singular points. With
reference to a specific family of driftless systems, we show how to build
a nonhomogeneous nilpotent approximation whose vector fields vary continuously
around singular points. It is also proven that the privileged coordinates
associated to such an approximation provide a uniform estimate of the distance.

<br><br>The subject of this paper is the motion control problem of wheeled
mobile robots (WMRs) in environments without obstacles. With reference
to the popular unicycle kinematics, it is shown that dynamic feedback linearization
is an efficient design tool leading to a solution simultaneously valid
for both trajectory tracking and set-point regulation problems. The implementation
of this approach on the laboratory prototype SuperMARIO, a two-wheel differentially-driven
mobile robot, is described in detail. To assess the quality of the proposed
controller, we compare its performance with that of several existing control
techniques in a number of experiments. The obtained results provide useful
guidelines for WMR control designers.

<br><br>This paper shows how to compute the nonholonomic distance between
a point-wise car-like robot and polygonal obstacles. Geometric constructions
to compute the shortest paths from a configuration (given orientation and
position in the plane of the robot) to a position (i.e., a configuration
with unspecified final orientation) are first presented. The geometric
structure of the reachable set (set of points in the plane reachable by
paths of given length l) is then used to compute the shortest paths to
straight-line segments. Obstacle distance is defined as the length of such
shortest paths. The algorithms are developed for robots that can move both
forward and backward (Reeds and Shepp car) or only forward (Dubins car).
They are based on the convexity analysis of the reachable set.&nbsp;

Postscript version</a>).</li>

<br><br>An algorithmic method is presented for the problem of autonomous
robot motion in completely unknown environments. Our approach is based
on the alternate execution of two fundamental processes: map building and
navigation. In the former, range measures are collected through the robot
exteroceptive sensors and processed in order to build a local representation
of the surrounding area. This representation is then integrated in the
global map so far reconstructed by filtering out insufficient or conflicting
information. In the navigation phase, an A*-based planner generates a local
path from the current robot position to the goal, that is safe inside the
visited area and proposes directions for further exploration. The robot
follows the path up to the boundary of the visited area, terminating its
motion if unexpected obstacles are encountered. The most peculiar aspects
of our method are (i) the use of fuzzy logic to build an environment map
that is very efficiently computed and modified, and (ii) the iterative
application of A*, that is a complete planning algorithm taking full advantage
local information. Experimental results of the implementation on a NOMAD
200 mobile robot show that the proposed method provides real-time performance
both in static and moderately dynamic environments.&nbsp;

<br><br>An essential component of an autonomous mobile robot is the exteroceptive
sensory system. Sensing capabilities should be integrated with a method
for extracting a representation of the environment from uncertain sensor
data and with an appropriate planning algorithm. In this paper, fuzzy logic
concepts are used to introduce a tool useful for robot perception as well
as for planning collision-free motions. In particular, a map of the environment
is defined as the fuzzy set of unsafe points, whose membership function
quantifies the possibility for each point to belong to an obstacle. The
computation of this set is based on a specific sensor model and makes use
of intermediate sets generated from range measures and aggregated by means
of fuzzy set operators. This general approach is applied to a robot with
ultrasonic rangefinders. The resulting map building algorithm performs
well, as confirmed by a comparison with stochastic methods. The planning
problem on fuzzy maps can be solved by defining various path cost functions,
corresponding to different strategies, and by searching the map for optimal
paths. To this end, proper instances of the A* algorithm are devised. Experimental
results for a Nomad 200 robot moving in a real-world environment are presented.&nbsp;

2, no. 4, pp. 355-374, 1996.</li>

<br><br>We present algorithms for robot path planning via navigation functions
on fuzzy maps. In this kind of bitmaps, a number is associated to each
cell, characterizing the possibility that it belongs to an obstacle. Such
a representation is useful when unknown environments are reconstructed
from sensor measures. Two methods are devised: both are based on a proper
modification of the wavefront expansion algorithm. The first is relatively
simple, but produces paths that may graze the obstacles. Instead, the second
method makes use of a properly defined skeleton of the map, that lies as
far as possible from such areas. The performance of the two methods is
illustrated by application to both simulated and experimental maps. The
proposed method is also extended to the case of nonholonomic wheeled mobile
robots.&nbsp;

<br><br>The opportunities offered by fuzzy logic to build maps for robot
navigation are investigated. Characteristics of points of the space (occupied,
free, uncertain, etc.) are easily expressed trough set theoretical operations.
Real world experiments validate the approach. The experimental set-up is
based on modified Polaroid ultrasonic sensors, however the approach can
be easily extended to incorporate other kinds of sensors.</ul>
