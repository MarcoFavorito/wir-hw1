  The Earley algorithm is a widely used parsing method in natural language
  processing applications. We introduce a variant of Earley parsing that is
  based on a "delayed" recognition of constituents. This allows us to start the
  recognition of a constituent only in cases in which all of its subconstituents
  have been found within the input string. This is particularly advantageous
  in several cases in which partial analysis of a constituent cannot be
  completed and in general in all cases of productions sharing some suffix of
  their right-hand sides (even for different left-hand side nonterminals).
  Although the two algorithms result in the same asymptotic time and space
  complexity, from a practical perspective our algorithm improves the time
  and space requirements of the original method, as shown by reported
  experimental results.
