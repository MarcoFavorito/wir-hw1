The article aims at establishing a logical approach to class-based data
modeling.  After a discussion on class-based formalisms for data modeling, we
introduce a family of logics, called Description Logics, which stem from
research on Knowledge Representation in Artificial Intelligence.  The logics of
this family are particularly well suited for specifying data classes and
relationships among classes, and are equipped with both formal semantics and
inference mechanisms.  We demonstrate that several popular data modeling
formalisms, including the Entity-Relationship Model, and the most common
variants of object-oriented data models, can be expressed in terms of specific
logics of the family.  For this purpose we use a unifying Description Logic,
which incorporates all the features needed for the logical reformulation of the
data models used in the various contexts.  We also discuss the problem of
devising reasoning procedures for the unifying formalism, and show that they
provide valuable supports for several important data modeling activities.
