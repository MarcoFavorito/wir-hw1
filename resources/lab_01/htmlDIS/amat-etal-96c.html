We present a general proof theoretical methodology for default systems. Given
a default theory <W, D> , the default rules D are simply understood as
restrictions on the tableaux construction of the logic. Different default
approaches have their own way of understanding these restrictions and
executing them. For each default approach (such as Reiter, Brewka or
Lukaszewicz), the allowable default extensions can be obtained from the
default tableau construction. The advantage of our approach, besides being
simple and neat, is in its generality: it allows for the development of a default
theory for any logic with a tableau formulation, such as intuitionistic logic,
linear logic or modal logic.
