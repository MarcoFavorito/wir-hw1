In this thesis we devise in an incremental manner a set of abstract knowledge
representation languages, called L-languages, and study reasoning on them.
Using L-languages one can build complex class and attribute expressions and
use these to define schemata for the representation of knowledge at the
intensional level. We first show that L-languages subsume in their more
expressive variants the structural aspects of most of the representation
formalisms used both in Knowledge Representation and in Databases. The
main part of the thesis is concerned with the design of effective techniques for
intensional reasoning on L-schemata and the study of their computational
properties. We first characterize the intrinsic complexity of reasoning on
L-schemata for a relevant class of languages and different types of schemata.
The expressivity of L-languages causes the finite model property not to hold
and we analyze separately reasoning with respect to both finite and
unrestricted models. In the case of unrestricted models we extend the
correspondence between L-languages and Propositional Dynamic Logics
(PDLs) and show decidability in deterministic exponential time for reasoning
in several L-languages. In the case of finite models we devise a novel reasoning
method which exploits linear programming techniques. The resulting
algorithms works in worst case deterministic single and double exponential
time, and exhibit efficient behaviour in meaningful practical cases.
