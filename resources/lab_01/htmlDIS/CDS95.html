                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>We prove that unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses at the second level the size of a purely propositional representation of the circumscription  CIRC(T )  of  a  propositional  formula  T  grows  faster
                   than any polynomial as the size of T  increases. We then analyze
                   the significance of this result in the related field of closed-world
                   reasoning.<p>
