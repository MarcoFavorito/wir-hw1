				<p><b>SharePoint Portal Server 2003</b> enables enterprises to develop an intelligent portal that seamlessly connects users, teams, and knowledge so that people can take advantage of relevant information across business processes to help them work more efficiently. SharePoint Portal Server 2003 provides an enterprise business solution that integrates information from various systems into one solution through single sign-on and enterprise application integration capabilities, with flexible deployment options and management tools. The portal facilitates end-to-end collaboration by enabling aggregation, organization, and search capabilities for people, teams, and information. Users can find relevant information quickly through customization and personalization of portal content and layout, as well as by audience targeting. Organizations can target information, programs, and updates to audiences based on their organizational role, team membership, interest, security group, or any other membership criteria that can be defined. 
<p>
SharePoint Portal Server 2003 uses Microsoft Windows® SharePoint Services 2003 sites to create portal pages for people, information, and organizations. The portal also extends the capabilities of Windows SharePoint Services sites with organization and management tools, and enables teams to publish information in their sites to the entire organization.
