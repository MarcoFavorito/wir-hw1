<h1>Ground nonmonotonic modal logics</h1>


<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In this paper we address ground logics, a family of nonmonotonic modal
logics, and their usage in knowledge representation.  In such a setting
first-order sentences are used to represent the knowledge of an agent about
the world, while an epistemic operator provides the agent with
autoepistemic or introspective knowledge.  Ground logics are based on the
idea of characterizing the knowledge of the agent by allowing it to make
nonmonotonic assumptions only with respect to the knowledge about the
world, i.e. expressed by nonmodal formulae.  They are characterized by a
fix-point equation which determines the set of formulae derivable from the
agent's initial knowledge and which can be applied to different normal
modal systems to obtain a variety of nonmonotonic modal logics.  In the
paper we address the semantical, computational and epistemological
properties of ground logics.  We provide a semantic characterization of
ground logics by defining a preference relation on possible-world models
based on the minimization of the knowledge expressed by nonmodal formulae.
We analyze the computational complexity of reasoning in ground logics,
providing both a lower bound through a reduction from quantified boolean
formulae and an upper bound through an algorithm for computing logical
entailment.  We discuss the representational features of ground logics, in
particular defaults, and provide a thorough comparison with McDermott and
Doyle's logics.
