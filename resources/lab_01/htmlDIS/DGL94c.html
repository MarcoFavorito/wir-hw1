                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>One of the main
                   themes in the area of Terminological Reasoning has been to identify description logics (DLs) that are both very Nevertheless, this
                   work has also made apparent the lack in the known PDL's of certain constructs needed to fully exploit the correspondence. These
                   are constructs to locally (wrt single states) constrain the running
                   of an atomic program or its converse (the running of the atomic
                   program  backward)  to  be  deterministic,  or  to  have  a  specified
                   amount of nondeterminism only. In fact, we believe that PDL's
                   can  take  advantage  of  this  kind  of  constructs  to  model  many
                   interesting properties of actual computations. In this paper, we
                   extend  Converse  PDL,  first  by  including  a  construct  for  local
                   determinism  of  simple  programs  (either  an  atomic  program  or
                   the converse of an atomic program), and then by including constructs for graded nondeterminism of simple programs. The latter
                   locally constrain the nondeterminism of simple programs by limiting the minimum and the maximum number of states satisfying
                   a specified property that are reachable by the running of a simple program from a certain state. The main result of the paper
                   is that both the resulting logics are strictly more expressive than


                   Converse  Deterministic  PDL  (Converse  PDL  where  all  atomic
                   programs are interpreted as partial functions), but still decidable
                   in deterministic exponential time.<p>
