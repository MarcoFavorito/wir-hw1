Catarci was born in Roma, November 6, 1961.</font>
<br><font size=+0>Master degree in Engineering, University of Roma "La
Sapienza", 1987.</font>
<br><font size=+0>PhD in Computer Science, University of Roma "La Sapienza",
1992.</font>
<br><font size=+0>Since 1987 she teaches courses in Computer Science at
Italian universities.</font>
<br><font size=+0>From1987 to 1990, from 1990 to 1998, and from 1998 to
2000 she was research assistant, assistant professor and associate professor
respectively at the University of Roma "La Sapienza", where she is now
a full professor.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Her main research interests are in theoretical and application-oriented
aspects of visual formalisms for databases and database design. With respect
to theory, she has studied problems related to the formalization and evaluation
of the expressive power of visual query languages.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Moreover, she has worked on semantic database modeling,
cooperative information systems, and</font>
<br><font size=+0>statistical databases. On these topics she has published
more than 80 articles in leading journals and</font>
<br><font size=+0>conferences and 5 books.</font>
<p><font size=+0>With respect to applications, she has led or participated
in various projects on visual query systems and developed methodologies
for database design, particularly related to translations between conceptual
and logical schemas, and to data distribution. Outside of academia, she
has been a consultant to large (private and government) organisations.</font>
<p><font size=+0>Dr. Catarci is regularly in the programming committees
of the main database conferences and has been the program co-chair of the
International Workshop on Advanced Visual Interfaces (AVI) in 1996 and
is in the AVI steering committee. AVI is bringing together researchers
in Human Computer Interaction and Databases since 1992.</font>
<p><font size=+0>She has been guest co-editor of two recent special issues
of the Journal of Visual Languages and Computing (on "Visual Query Languages")
and of ACM SIGMOD Record (on "Information Visualization").</font>
<p><font size=+0>She is the program co-chair of the 2000 edition of the
IFIP 2.6 Conference on Visual Database Systems (VDB5).</font>
<br><font size=+0>She is member of the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</font>
