In this paper we investigate the usefulness of preprocessing part
of the input of a given problem to improve the efficiency.   We
extend the results of [Cadoli et al.   ISTCS, 1996] by giving
sufficient conditions to prove the unfeasibility of reducing the
on-line complexity via an off-line preprocessing.   We analyze the
problems of diagnosis, planning, reasoning about actions, and
belief revision.   We analyze other problems from various fields.
