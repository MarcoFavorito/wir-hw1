  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We consider a generic paradigm 
    to design improved approximation schemes for linear programming relaxations 
    of combinatorial optimization problems. For the case of the uncapacitated 
    facility location problem, the scheduling problem R || Cmax and the set covering 
    problem we substantially improve the running time dependence on e from the 
    previously known O(1/e^2) to O(1/e). For the survivable network design problem 
    we improve the dependence from O(1/e^2) to O((1/e) log(1/e)). We present some 
    preliminary computational results that seem to suggest that our algorithms 
    may prove very competitive in practice. Our results build mainly on work of 
    Nesterov and extend the work of Bienstock and Iyengar. This talk will be primarily 
    based on the uncapacitated facility location problem and assumes no previous 
    knowledge of the subject.</font></P>
