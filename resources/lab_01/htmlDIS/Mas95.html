                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The  goal  of  this
                   paper  is  to  present  and  discuss  a  simple  and  rather  effective
                   tableau calculus which combines modal logics of knowledge and
                   belief with contextual reasoning. The system is made by a multiple combination. For modal proofs,  it labels formulae as prefixed tableaux but uses message (knowledge) passing rules similar to those of sequent-like tableaux. For contextual deduction,
                   it merges the metalevel information of the labelling system used
                   by Multicontextual Languages with that used by Labelled Deductive Systems. Its semantics is also simple and intuitively based on
                   a property of Kripke models. The resulting calculus (k-Clusters
                   Tableaux) is effective for automated proofs, applicable to a wide
                   range of modal logics, and adaptable to many search heuristics.<p>
                   It  is  also  easy  to  use  for  proof  presentation  since  its  rule  have
                   intuitive epistemic interpretation (how knowledge and belief can
                   be inherited up and down possible worlds). It is weak enough to
                   satisfy a KB where two consistent modal statements may globally contradict each other (in classical logic), but strong enough
                   to rule out an inconsistent statement.<p>
