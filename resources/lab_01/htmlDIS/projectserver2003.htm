				<P><B>Overview</B>
<P><B>Businesses function better when people, and projects are working together 
toward a common goal aligned with the overall strategic direction.</B> The 
challenges facing businesses today—including mobile workers, and distributed 
operations, can make it difficult to keep people connected and moving in the 
same direction. Microsoft Project Server is a business solution that provides 
web based project collaboration and analysis tools you need to make informed, 
proactive decisions. 
<P>Project Server 2003 links with Outlook 2000 or higher and Excel 2000 or 
higher, as well as with SharePoint, allowing users to access and change 
information about their projects using Office tools. For example, a project 
manager can assign a task to a team member and that task will automatically show 
up in that team member's Outlook calendar. Using Outlook, the team member can 
report progress and time spent on the project. </P>
