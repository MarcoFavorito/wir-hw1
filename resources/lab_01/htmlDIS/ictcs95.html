<H1> Minimal models in propositional logics: approximation results </H1>


<H2> Abstract </H2>

  In this work we define optimization problems concerning different
  notions of models. In particular, we analyze the different settings
  of two, three and four-valued propositional logic: in each setting
  we focus on the problem of minimizing the number of literals
  belonging to a model or maximizing the number of literals that do
  not belong to a model of a CNF formula.
  First, we formulate these problems as the optimization versions of
  well-known model-finding problems in Artificial Intelligence,
  concerning the areas of nonmonotonic reasoning and abductive
  reasoning.  Then, we characterize these problems in terms of
  complexity approximation classes.  We state, from one side, negative
  results concerning non-approximability in polynomial time for the
  general problems, and find, from the other side, syntactical
  restrictions that allow for approximate solutions.
