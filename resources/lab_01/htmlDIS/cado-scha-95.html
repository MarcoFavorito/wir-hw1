We propose a technique for dealing with the high complexity of reasoning
under propositional default logic and circumscription. The technique is based
on the notion of approximation: A logical consequence relation is computed by
means of sound and progressively "more complete" relations, as well as
complete and progressively "more sound" ones. Both sequences generated in
this way converge to the original consequence relation and are easier to
compute. Moreover they are given a clear semantics based on multivalued
logic. With this tecnique unsoundness and incompleteness are introduced ina
controlled way and precisely characterized.
