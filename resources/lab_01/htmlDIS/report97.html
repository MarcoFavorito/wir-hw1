      <P><h2>Introduction</h2>


      <P>The Artificial Intelligence research group is mainly working in Knowledge
      Representation, Planning, Search and Natural Language Processing.
      Knowledge Representation deals with languages, formalisms, and the
      associated reasoning apparatus, including complexity of reasoning. Within
      Knowledge Representation we are mainly concerned with the following topics:
      <OL>
      <LI>  The development of suitable formalisms to support various aspects of
            reasoning and to combine different logics, which in the following pages
            are collected under the title "Commonsense reasoning";

      <LI>  The specification of formal languages for knowledge representation,
            which integrate different logics and formalisms, though maintaining nice
            computational properties. These topics are illustrated in the section on
            "Description logics";

      <LI>  The investigation of languages for programs, actions, intentions and, in
            general, languages to represent changes. Research done on these
            languages is described in the Sections titled "Modal and dynamic logics"
            and "Reasoning about actions";

<LI>  The study of computational properties of formalisms and languages, and other
      usually adopted reasoning tools. These topics are illustrated in the Section
      "Complexity of Reasoning". </OL>
      <P>Research on description logics, actions, commonsense reasoning and
      complexity led to the realization of tools and techniques that support the
      specification and implementation of software for controlling the mobile robot
      Tino.
      <P>The international recognition of the achievements in the field of knowledge
      representation is highlighted by the choice of Prof. Luigia Carlucci Aiello as
      conference chair of next IJCAI - International Joint Conference on Artificial
      Intelligence, the main worldwide conference on AI - to be held in Stockholm,
      1999, and Maurizio Lenzerini as chairman of the Fifth Conference of the Italian
      Association for Artificial Intelligence AI*IA'97 <A HREF="/~ai/citations/lenz-97.html">[Len97]</A>. Maurizio
      Lenzerini will also be invited speaker at the next Conference on the Principles
      of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR'98) to be held in Trento.
      <P>Research in other areas of AI, like Planning, Scheduling and Natural
      Language Processing has been quite active in developing tools for applications
      to real cases and prototypes.
      <P>The planning research group has devised algorithms, heuristics and suitable
      formalisms to realize flexible architectures for planning and scheduling. This
      work is described in the section on "Knowledge-based architectures for
      planning and scheduling".





<P>The work on "Constraint Reasoning and Scheduling" is divided in two
parts: the design of new search procedure based on the local search paradigm
and the definition and development of a new imperative programming
language that supports both declarative programming and constraints.
<P>Finally, the group working on"Natural Language" has been developing a
prototype combining natural language and hypertextual descriptions.

<h2>Commonsense Reasoning</h2>


<P>As a general issue commonsense reasoning investigates the reasoning
mechanisms of an agent interacting with the real world in which she often has
to take the troublesome decision of completing or withdrawing information in
order to be coherent with her observations and undertake suitable actions.
Classical formalisms such as first-order logics are, in general, inadequate to
deal with the complex reasoning task required by a human-level intelligent
agent behaving, with commonsense, in the real world. Therefore different
forms of reasoning, such as nonmonotonic reasoning, belief revision, abduction,
contextual reasoning etc., have been devised in the knowledge representation
research community to challenge limitations of classical formalisms with new
forms of reasoning mechanisms. The above research areas are investigated by
the research group working on commonsense reasoning and new results are
described in the following subsections.

<h3>Nonmonotonic Reasoning</h3>

<P>The central problem of nonmonotonic reasoning is now that of providing an
adequate notion of nonmonotonic provability together with a methodology for
nonmonotonic inference and studying its computational properties. This
approach to nonmonotonic reasoning provides both proof-theoretical and
mechanical strategies to treat agent reasoning and the logical basis to admit
for a unified view of the different formalisms proposed.
<P>It turns out that logics able to embed nonmonotonic inference are modal
logics that allow for context dependent form of reasoning requiring, in its turn,
context dependent proofs. In fact, the natural way to express the meta logical
concepts involved in nonmonotonic inference like "it is provable" or "it is
consistent to assume" is to turn to modal operators.
<P>Most of the works from our "nonmonotonic reasoning group" deal with the
family of modal logics in which nonmonotonic formalisms are embeddable,
namely <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-aiel-pirr-97a.html">[ACP97a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-aiel-pirr-97b.html">[ACP97b]</A>





<A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR97.html">[DNR97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/gabb-pirr-97a.html">[GP97a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/gabb-pirr-97b.html">[GP97b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97.html">[Ros97c]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97b.html">[Ros97a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97c.html">[Ros97b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97d.html">[Ros97]</A>, together with a study on the expressiveness of some of
such modal logics and in general on the methodologies for nonmonotonic
inference.
<h4>Ground Logics</h4>

<P>The study of ground nonmonotonic modal logics, a variant of
nonmonotonic modal logics due to McDermott and Doyle, has been carried
out in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR97.html">[DNR97]</A>. First, a possible-world semantics for ground
logics is presented, which both generalizes the notion of minimal knowledge
and provides a semantic characterization for this class of modal formalisms.
Then, the computational properties of ground logics are analyzed. A major
result is that reasoning in the ground logic for the modal system S5 can be
placed at the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. It is also proved that this
is a lower bound for reasoning in all ground logics, and an upper bound for
most of such formalisms. Finally, several representational features of ground
logics are discussed, in particular defaults and forward rules, and a thorough
comparison with McDermott and Doyle's logics is provided.
<P>The relationship between minimal knowledge and McDermott and Doyle's
nonmonotonic modal logics is further analyzed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97d.html">[Ros97]</A>, which
studies the problem of embedding Halpern and Moses's modal logic of minimal
knowledge states into two families of modal formalisms for nonmonotonic
reasoning, McDermott and Doyle's nonmonotonic modal logics and ground
nonmonotonic modal logics. First, it is shown that Halpern and Moses's logic
can be embedded into all ground logics; moreover, the translation employed
allows for establishing a lower bound for the problem of skeptical reasoning in
all ground logics. Then, a translation of Halpern and Moses's logic into a
significant subset of McDermott and Doyle's formalisms is presented. Such a
translation both indicates the ability of Halpern and Moses's logic of
expressing minimal knowledge states in a more compact way than McDermott
and Doyle's logics, and allows for a comparison of the epistemological
properties of such nonmonotonic modal formalisms.
<P>A computational characterization of the propositional fragment of MBNF,
the bimodal logic of minimal belief and negation as failure introduced by
Lifschitz, is presented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97.html">[Ros97c]</A>. In particular, it is shown that
the problem of reasoning in the propositional fragment of MBNF lies at the
third level of the polynomial hierarchy, whereas reasoning with MBNF theories
without nested occurrences of the modalities lies at the second level of the
polynomial hierarchy. This last result implies that, under the stable model
semantics, increasing the syntax of the logic program, by allowing
propositional formulas as goals in the rules, does not affect the worst-case
complexity of deduction for disjunctive programs with negation as failure.
<P>The epistemological properties of Lifschitz's logic MKNF (a variant of





MBNF) are investigated in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97c.html">[Ros97b]</A>. In particular, it is shown
that the expressive power of MKNF is equivalent to Moore's autoepistemic
logic (AEL), by defining an embedding of MKNF into AEL and vice versa. It
is also proved that the negation as failure modality not of MKNF exactly
corresponds to the negative introspection operator in AEL. The two previous
results imply that MKNF's minimal knowledge modality K can be represented
by means of negation as failure not, which in turn implies that negation as
failure is "more expressive" than minimal knowledge.
<P>A study of the computational properties of Levesque's logic of only
knowing is provided in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Rosa97b.html">[Ros97a]</A>. In particular, it is shown that
reasoning about only knowing in the propositional case lies at the second level
of the polynomial hierarchy. Thus, it is as hard as reasoning in the majority of
propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning, like default logic,
circumscription and autoepistemic logic, and it is easier than reasoning in
propositional formalisms based on the minimal knowledge paradigm, which is
strictly related to the notion of only knowing.
<h4>Provability Logics</h4>

<P>One of the central issue in nonmonotonic logic is to establish a notion of
nonmonotonic provability, which is usually characterized via some modal logic
together with a suitable construction. The central result presented in the
paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-aiel-pirr-97a.html">[ACP97a]</A> is the identification of a modal logic,
KD4Z as the logic of nonmonotonic provability. In fact in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-aiel-pirr-97a.html">[ACP97a]</A> a fixed point construction is presented, which
allows for the interpretation of the necessity modal operator as a nonmonotonic
provability operator analogously to that used in the modal logic of provability
for Peano Arithmetic. The logic proposed is a fixed point logic that can be
extended to first order modal logic, under some limitations. By means of the
fixed point results many nonmonotonic formalisms can be expressed at the
language level, that is, without any further meta-logical construction, besides
the modal operators. Furthermore the way nonmonotonic assertions can be
translated into such a logic allows for many forms of contextual reasoning.
Therefore also contextual definitions of concepts, topic in particular discussed
in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-pirr-97FS.html">[AP97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-pirr-97.html">[AP97]</A>, can be resolved with
the proposed translation. Fixed point equations provide, in fact, a
generalization, which correctly captures the relativized context, of explicit
definitions of natural kinds, that is, concepts like lemon or chair, which,
without referring to a suitable context, would not be explicitly definable.
<h4>Automated Deduction in NMR</h4>

<P>Minimization is at the core of nonmonotonic or diagnostic reasoning.
Prime implicants, as the simplest compiled form of a theory, enjoy nice
properties when minimization is taken into account. They have both a
syntactic and semantic interest as, in fact, syntactically they represent the





simplest formula implying a given theory and semantically they coincide with
the diagram of a minimal three-valued models of a theory, when propositional
or decidable fragments of first-order logic are concerned.
<P>A new approach for selective enumeration of prime implicants is presented
in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/palo-pirr-pizz-97.html">[PPP97]</A>.The method uses a 0-1 programming schema,
having feasible solutions corresponding to formula implicants. Prime
implicants are generated one at a time, so that as many of them can be
computed as needed by the specific application considered. Selective
generation is also supported, whereby preferences on the structure of
generated prime implicants can be specified. Based on this approach, two
algorithms for selective enumeration of prime implicants are presented and
their properties discussed. Experimental results are presented which confirm
the effectiveness of the approach as applied to "hard" problem instances.

<h3>Belief Revision</h3>

<P>Belief Revision is an area of commonsense reasoning involving the problem
of changing a knowledge base as a result of a contradictory observation.
<P>The paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97.html">[Lib97b]</A> contains an analysis of the complexity of
revising a knowledge base when an iteration of this process is necessary. The
analysis concerns both the classical problems of belief revision (inference,
model checking, computation of the new base) and new issues, related to the
problem of "committing" the changes.
<P>Belief update is a different form of belief change. Revision and update
serve different purposes. In the last few years, more attention has been paid to
belief update, and many formalizations have been introduced.
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97-c.html">[Lib97a]</A> reports the results of the analysis of the complexity of
the proposals presented in the literature. Some of those proposals have also
been related to previous work on closed world reasoning.
<P>Arbitration is a third form of belief revision. It is defined as a "symmetric"
merging of two or more knowledge bases. In many scenarios, there are two or
more knowledge bases that represent the same domain. The problem of
arbitration is to consistently merge all the information coming from different
sources. The paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-scha-97.html">[LS97a]</A> contains the definition of general
principles of arbitration, as well as a semantical representation of the
arbitration operators.
<P>Relating formalisms is useful both from a semantical and computational
point of view. The paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-scha-97-b.html">[LS97b]</A> contains a complete set of
reduction from various belief revision operators to the well-studied
non-monotonic operator of circumscription.

<h3>Contextual reasoning</h3>

<P>Among the various formalisms developed to deal with contextual reasoning,
McCarthy has proposed the logic of context with the ist (c; p) modality as
foundational formalism.





<P>A novel account of contexts, formalized as fixed point equations in the
modal logic QKD4Z is presented in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-pirr-97FS.html">[AP97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-pirr-97.html">[AP97]</A>. This offers the ability to
represent consistency and provability at the object level, with which one can
then represent various relationships that must hold between different contexts,
such as inheritance, disjointness, compatibility, etc. The logic also offers the
ability to name contexts and to obtain explicit sentential representations for
these by solving suitable fixed point equations. We illustrate our approach by
examples concerning default inheritance of contexts, contradictory contexts,
integration of multiple contexts.
<P>The need of an explicit modeling for the usage of reasoning resources by an
intelligent agent is tackled in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/weyh-cado-talc-98.html">[WCT98]</A>. In particular,
notions such as problems, solutions, and problem solving activities -which are
usually left implicit in the discussions of autonomous agents- are explicitly
described and a framework to reason about them is provided. This work
describes the architecture of a reasoner, who solves puzzles (built from a finite
number of components) and reasons about knowledge, by explicitly using the
notion of resource.
<P>Finally, in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/sang-97.html">[San97]</A>, knowledge contextualization is used to
make local reasoning and solve planning and negotiation problems in an
uniform fashion. Each context is a set of constraints to the agent action used
to describe both plans and agreement offers. A special meta-backtracking
mechanism among contexts is used to achieve a globally consistent solution to
the context constraints.

<h2>Combining Logics</h2>


<P>The need to combine logics arises in computer science and in logic itself as
a discipline supporting other research areas. As logic is used more and more as
a formal tool in other disciplines the need for ever more expressive formal
languages is becoming crucial. An increasing number of features from the
applied area of computer science need to be formalized, for example artificial
intelligence, software verification, operating systems, specification of
programming languages, multimedia systems and multimodal computing,
database and information retrieval and database transactions, diagnosis,
hardware design and hardware verification. Two issues of the journal Studia
Logica have been dedicated to combination of logics
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/gabb-pirr-97a.html">[GP97a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/gabb-pirr-97b.html">[GP97b]</A> in which eleven articles
have been selected among many submissions from different areas.
<P>The papers on combination of logics offer a wide and rich perspective on
why combining logic is interesting and what is gained. They offer a large
panorama on combining modalities. Authors have investigated how to
combine modalities such as beliefs and time, actions and beliefs, for specifying
communication among agents; combining probabilities and modalities for





modeling systems that have to reason about utility, choices and have to take
decisions on this basis; combining probabilities and first order logic to model
uncertainty, information processing and decision strategies; combining first
order logic with itself, to model self reference and contextual reasoning.

<h2>Description Logics</h2>


<P>The goal of this research is to study the foundations of a logical approach
to structured knowledge representation languages, with regard to both the
expressive power and the computational properties of the associated reasoning
techniques. The definition of knowledge bases by means of structured
knowledge representation languages is done by specifying a terminological
knowledge base (TBox), where concepts are defined, along with an assertional
knowledge base (ABox), where facts about individuals are stated in terms of
these concepts.
<P>A complete picture of the complexity of subsumption between concept
expressions (without any TBox) appeared in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DLNN97.html">[DLNN97]</A>.
<P>The addition of epistemic modal operators to Description Logics has been
continued in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR97b.html">[DNR97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/doni-lenz-nard-scha-nutt-98.html">[DLNetal98]</A>, where
limited forms of epistemic statements are included in the statements of the
TBox. The decidability of the main reasoning problems for this extended
Description Logic is proved.
<P>Description logics have also been used to formalize Data-Flow Diagrams in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/Comp-Doni-Rumo-97b.html">[CDR97]</A>. A semantics of processes through
particular individuals is proposed, while data is modeled by concepts as usual.
It is proved that the corresponding Description Logics is a very simple one,
and complexity results about solving satisfiability of a knowledge base carry
over to coherence of a Data-Flow Diagram. More generally, Description Logics
are applied to reasoning in Conceptual Modelling and Analysis in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/Comp-97a.html">[Com97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Comp-Rumo-97a.html">[CR97b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/Comp-Rumo-97b.html">[CR97a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Comp-Rumo-97d.html">[CR97]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/Comp-Doni-Rumo-97b.html">[CDR97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Comp-Rumo-98a.html">[CR98]</A>.
<P>In the description of the properties of concepts in a TBox, sometimes the
properties are necessary and sufficient (in this case they define the concept)
and sometimes they are only necessary. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/buch-doni-nutt-scha-98.html">[BDNS98]</A> a splitting of the TBox is proposed,
into a schema, with concept having only necessary condition, and a view, with
completely defined concepts. The division recalls the similar division into a
hierarchy of classes, and a hierarchy of queries in Object-Oriented Databases.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-nard-98.html">[CDGLN98]</A> techniques for reasoning in very
expressive description logics are studied. In such logics the finite model
property fails and finiteness of the interpretation domain has to be taken into
account explicitly. Reasoning is analyzed separately for the unrestricted case,





i.e. when considering arbitrary, possibly infinite models, and for the finite case,
i.e. when only finite models are taken into account, and different techniques
are presented. Finally, a detailed discussion on the borderline between
decidability and undecidability is presented.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-lenz-nard-98.html">[CLN98]</A> a logical approach to class-based data
modeling is established. It is shown that description logics are particularly
well suited for specifying data classes and relationships among classes, and
that several popular data modeling formalisms, including the
Entity-Relationship Model, and the most common variants of object-oriented
data models, can be expressed in terms of specific logics of the family. For this
purpose a unifying description logic is used, which incorporates all the features
needed for the logical reformulation of the data models used in the various
contexts. The problem of devising reasoning procedures for the unifying
formalism is also discussed, and it is shown that they provide valuable
supports for several important data modeling activities.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-lenz-97.html">[CL97]</A> a new data model is defined, which extends the
basic core of current object-oriented data models with several expressive
constructs, such as the inverse of attributes, the union, the intersection and
the complement of classes, the possibility of using nonbinary relations, and the
possibility of expressing cardinality constraints on attributes and relations. A
technique is presented both for checking the consistency of class definitions,
and for computing the logical consequences of the knowledge represented in
the schema. Finally, it is shown how the reasoning techniques support the
process of data reengignering.
<P>Recent research points out that query containment is a central problem in
several database and knowledge base applications, including data warehousing,
data integration, query optimization, and (materialized) view maintenance. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-97-b.html">[CDGL97a]</A> a decision procedure is presented for
containment of conjunctive queries defined over a database schema specified in
a very expressive description logic, comprising n-ary relations and general
inclusion axioms on both concepts and relations. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-98.html">[CDGL98a]</A> these results are extended to the case where
the queries are nonrecursive Datalog programs whose atoms are complex
expressions that may contain the transitive closure operator.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lenz-JAIR-97.html">[DGL97]</A> a special description logic is developed
that allows for the coexistence, in the same TBox, of recursive/cyclic
assertions (or definitions) interpreted according to the different semantics
proposed in literature. The different semantics have a complementary role.
For example inductive definitions of concepts are captured by the
Least-Fixpoint Semantics, while coinductive definitions are captured by the
Greatest-Fixpoint Semantics, finally the Descriptive Semantics is the only one
able to assign meaning to general inclusion assertions. The proposed
description logic, an extension of ALC   called Mu-ALCQ, captures the various
intended meanings by allowing in the language explicit fixpoint-constructs.





Besides the fixpoint constructs, Mu-ALCQ is equipped with "qualified number
restrictions" to express very general cardinality constraint on links. In the
paper the EXPTIME-decidability of the logic is proved by exposing a tight
correspondence with a logic of programs (extension of propositional dynamic
logic), called modal mu-calculus, used to reason about temporal properties of
concurrent processes.
<P>As shown in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-97.html">[CDGL97b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-98b.html">[CDGL98]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-lenz-98.html">[CL98]</A>, very expressive
description logics allow one to represent both semi-structured data and
Document Type Definitions (DTDs) expressed in the Standard Generalized
Markup Language. To this end the possibility to express transitive closure and
to impose finite nesting on structures is fundamental. The proposed
formalization provides a method for verifying various forms of equivalence of
semi-structured data schemas and DTDs, which works in worst case
deterministic exponential time, in contrast to the known algorithms for this
problem which are double exponential. The reasoning services studied in this
paper can be seen as the fundamental building blocks for devising more
complex inference systems supporting the task of querying the World Wide
Web.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Io-Na-97.html">[IN97]</A> the approaches to knowledge-based system to
access information on the World Wide Web are analysed, with particular
emphasis on the use on Description Logics as a modeling language. The work
on intelligent access to the World Wide Web is described in greater detail
under the section World Wide Web Access in the chapter on Data Bases.
<P>As shown in the survey <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-nard-rosa-97.html">[CDGLetal97a]</A>, in
recent years there has been a growing interest in accessing, relating, and
combining data from multiple sources. Indeed, Information Integration is one
of the core problems in distributed databases, cooperative information
systems, and data warehousing, which are key areas in the software
development industry.
<P>Two critical factors for the design and maintenance of applications
requiring Information Integration are conceptual modeling of the domain, and
reasoning support over the conceptual representation. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-nard-rosa-97-b.html">[CDGLetal97b]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-nard-rosa-98.html">[CDGLetal98b]</A> it is demonstrated that
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning techniques can play an important
role for both these factors, by proposing a Description Logic based framework
for Information Integration. It is shown that the development of successful
Information Integration solutions requires not only to resort to very expressive
Description Logics, but also to significantly extend them. A novel approach to
conceptual modeling for Information Integration is presented, which allows for
suitably modeling the global concepts of the application, the individual
information sources, and the constraints among different sources. Moreover,
inference procedures for the fundamental reasoning services are devised,





namely relation and concept subsumption, and query containment. A
methodological framework for Information Integration is presented, which can
be applied in several contexts, and highlights the role of reasoning services
within the design process. Finally, a framework for expressing queries using
Datalog and Description Logics has been studied in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/doni-lenz-nard-scha-98.html">[DLNS98]</A>.

<h2>Modal and Dynamic Logics</h2>


<P>This research activity has focussed on the development of effective
deductions methods for dynamic and modal logics which have a number of
important applications in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Security. In
particular there has been a twofold focus on
   o the development of efficient deduction methods in the general case,

   o the application of tableaux methods to problems of computer security
     modeled with modal and dynamic logics.

On the first issue, the work <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-98-c.html">[Mas98]</A> tackles the developemtn of
tableaux methods for a wide range of modal logic and compares the
computational characteristics of this method with other methods presented in
the literature. It also solves (positively) the problem of decidability for the
modal logic of positive introspection S4 and establish a number of bounds for
the space and time complexity of this and other deduction methods for modal
logic.
An advance since the work of Pratt in 1982 has been the development of
tableaux method and algorithms directly for CPDL. A prefixed tableaux
calculus for CPDL is devised in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-mass-97.html">[DGM97]</A>, based on a
combination of different techniques such as prefixed tableaux for modal logics
and model checkers for mu-calculus. The calculus, which is naively worst-case
NEXPTIME, is transformed into an EXPTIME algorithm (recall that CPDL
is EXPTIME-complete) but using careful techniques which make full use also
of failed computations.
A further improvement has been achieved in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-d.html">[Mas97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-e.html">[Mas97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-98-b.html">[Mas98]</A> with the
introduction of the operation of simplification which plays for tableaux the
same role as subsumption for resolution and unit for Davis-Putnam. Beside its
computational effectiveness, the simplicity and generality of simplification
allows for its extension to a wide range of modal logics in a uniform way. This
work also combines theoretical and experimental results for random SAT and
IFIP benchmarks.



<h3>Access Control & Computer Security</h3>

<P>The development of tableaux methods for access control and computer
security has been tackled in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97.html">[Mas97c]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-98.html">[Mas98]</A>. These





works present a prefixed tableaux method for the calculus developed at the
Digital System Resource Centre by Abadi, Lampson et. al. for the formal
verification of authentication and access controls systems. Beside the
applicative interest, the calculus poses interesting technical challenges, since it
has not the tree-model property, introduces relations between modalities which
cannot be compiled into axiom schemata, and has some features of the
universal modality.
<P>This approach has been extended to the new security formalism based on
Role-Based access control in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-b.html">[Mas97b]</A>.

<h2>Reasoning about Actions</h2>


<P>The Situation Calculus is the most used formalism for reasoning about
actions in Artificial Intelligence. Its expressiveness allows the integration of
various aspects of dynamic systems in a unique formalism. Because of this
flexibility it has been chosen by several research projects on reasoning about
actions. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lesp-leve-IJCAI-97.html">[DGLL97]</A> techniques originally
developed to assign a "structural operational semantics" to concurrent
processes in Process Algebra are used to formalize concurrent (complex)
actions in the Situation Calculus. Concurrent actions are specified as
programs of a special "logical" programming language called Congolog,
which is able to express concurrency, interrupts, shared memory massage
passing between processes, etc. Congolog's programs are designed to be
executed on partially specified environments where exogenous (external)
events may occur at any time. The frame problem is dealt with by suitably
composing Reiter's solution for atomic actions.
<P>The work in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-reit-tern-AAAIWS-97.html">[DGTR97]</A> develops a logical
formalization of non-terminating Golog programs that are intended to be
used for controlling robots under the incomplete information on the initial
situation and on the behavior of the environment (exogenous actions are
allowed). As is the case for more conventional programs, some reliability
assurances for robot controllers are desirable. The paper describes a general
framework based on classical (second order) logic, to express and prove
properties of Golog programs, including non-terminating ones, in such a
setting.
<P>The work in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-reit-sout-KR-98.html">[GSR98a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-reit-sout-CS-98.html">[GSR98b]</A> studies,
within the setting of the Situation Calculus, the problem of monitoring the
execution of robot programs. The kind of execution monitors these papers
focus on make use of the robot sensors to detect discrepancies between the
actual world and the robot's internal representation of it, and attempt to
restore discrepancies by executing general recovery procedures. The approach
is demonstrated by proposing a simple implementation of an executor monitor
whose recovery procedure is based on planning a sequence of actions to restore





discrepancies so that the execution of the original robot's program can
continue.
<P>Like classical planning, the execution of high-level agent programs requires
a reasoner to look all the way to a final goal state before even a single action
can be taken in the world. This deferral is a serious problem in practice for
large programs. Furthermore, the problem is compounded in the presence of
sensing actions which provide necessary information, but only after they are
executed in the world. To deal with this, in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-leve-98.html">[DGL98]</A>
proposes a new incremental way of interpreting such high-level programs and a
new high-level language construct, which together, and without loss of
generality, allow much more control to be exercised over when actions can be
executed. Such a scheme is argued to be the only practical way to deal with
large agent programs containing both nondeterminism and sensing.
<P>The work in<A HREF="/~ai/citations/pirr-reit-97.html">[PR97]</A> is focused on a rich axiomatization for
actions in the situation calculus that includes, among other features, a solution
to the frame problem for deterministic actions. The work is foundational in
nature, directed at simplifying the entailment problem for these axioms.
Specifically, four contributions to the metatheory of axiomatizations of
dynamical systems in the Situation Calculus are given: 1) It is proved that the
above-mentioned axiomatization for actions has a relative satisfiability
property; the full axiomatization is satisfiable iff a small subset of it is. 2) The
concept of regression relative to these axioms is defined, and a soundness and
completeness theorem is proved for a regression-based solution to the
entailment problem for a wide class of queries. 3) The formalization of the
situation calculus requires certain foundational axioms specifying the domain
of situations. These include an induction axiom, whose presence complicates
human and automated reasoning in the situation calculus. Various classes of
sentences are presented, whose proofs do not require induction, and in some
cases, some of the other foundational axioms. 4) It is proved that the logic
programming language Golog never requires any of the foundational axioms
for the evaluation of programs.
<P>The language of the situation calculus is extended in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-97b.html">[Err97]</A>
in order to deal with the cognitive state of agents acting in a dynamic
environment. (Part of this work has also appeared in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-97.html">[Err97]</A> and a
revised version will appear in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-98.html">[Err98]</A>.) Furthermore, a suitable
language extension and theory have also been worked out with the aim to
express communication among agents, in terms of speech acts. Finally, the
language is proposed as a tool for the problem of User Modeling in intelligent
interactive systems. To this aim User Modeling is recasted as the problem of
modeling agents in a dynamic environment.
<P>An alternative way of reasoning about actions is studied in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/chen-degi-AIJ-97.html">[CDG98]</A>, where a "model checking" approach is
followed, in contrast to the usual "validity checking" one. A dynamic system is
modeled, by means of a suitable description formalism (a process algebra), as





a transition graph which represents all the possible system evolutions in terms
of state changes caused by actions. As reasoning formalism, a suitable
extension of modal mu-calculus is adopted. A property of the dynamic system
is verified by checking the truth-value of a formula, in the corresponding
transition graph (model checking). This setting inherits from the vast
literature on process algebras tools for dealing with complex systems, treating
suitably important aspects like parallelism, communications, interruptions,
coordinations among agents. Moreover reasoning by model checking (which
presuppose complete information on the behavior of the system) is typically
much easier than more general logical services such as validity checking.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-etal-AAAIWS-97.html">[DGINR97a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-etal-98.html">[DGINR98]</A> the
studies on a mobile robot equipped with autonomous reasoning capabilities is
presented. The robot, making use of such capabilities, is able to reason on the
surrounding environment and on the actions available in order to derive a plan
for reaching specified goals (as moving around in an office environment). The
reasoning services are based on a formalization of reasoning about actions and
planning in propositional dynamic logics, and exploit the correspondence
between PDLs and DLs to take advantage of efficient forms of weakened
reasoning. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-etal-ECP-97.html">[DGINR97b]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-etal-DL-97.html">[DGINR97c]</A> the
generation of conditional plans, whose conditions have to be sensed form the
environment, is addressed, and a suitable reasoning method id defined in which
a plan is extracted from a constructive proof of a query expressing a given goal.
<P>The use of dynamic logic for modeling planning problems of industrial
relevance has been developed further in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97.html">[Mas97c]</A>. This work
proposes to represent the verification of security properties by modeling
security attacks as plans. Rather then achieving "positive" goals a planner
must exploit the structure of a security protocol and coordinate the
communications steps of the agents and the network (or a potential enemy) to
reach a security violation. The planning problem is formalized with a variant
of dynamic logic where actions are explicit computation (such as
cryptanalyzing a message) and communications steps between agents.
<P>Also the complexity of A-action description language, a formalism to
express reasoning about actions scenarios (scenarios in which the world of
interest is modified by actions), has been studied in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97-b.html">[Lib97]</A>.
This is the first study about the complexity of action languages.

<h2>Complexity of reasoning</h2>


<P>Efficiency of AI systems is important for their success, as it is important in
all engineering projects. If we are to use logic as the major tool for Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning we have to deal with computational aspects.
<P>Logical inference is an extraordinarily powerful computational device, and
problems in logic are known among computer scientists for their high





      computational complexity. As an example, the prototypical recursively
      enumerable, non-recursive problem is to check whether a formula of first-order
      logic is valid. In other words a reasoner that represents its knowledge by
      means of a first-order formula and uses a sound and complete procedure for
      checking the validity of its knowledge has as much computational power as a
      Turing machine. The reasoner might give up full expressiveness and represent
      its knowledge in formulae of propositional logic, still using a sound and
      complete consistency checking procedure. In this case, it is important to recall
      that checking whether a formula of propositional logic is consistent is the
      paradigmatic NP-complete problem, which means that the reasoner faces a
      problem which probably requires exponential time.
      <P>In 1997, the AI group has continued the investigation on fundamental
      properties of complexity of reasoning, with the overall goal of designing
      computationally efficient and adequately expressive systems for Knowledge
      Representation and Reasoning. In particular, research has focused on the
      following topics: <OL>
      <LI> computational complexity of specific logical formalisms;

      <LI> complexity and expressiveness of query languages for relational
           databases, which are based on knowledge representation ideas;

      <LI> logical compilation of knowledge;

      <LI> experimental analysis of computationally hard problems;

<LI>  approximation of logical inference to gain efficiency. </OL>
      <P>As for point 1, the papers <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97-c.html">[Lib97a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-97.html">[Lib97b]</A>
      contain the analysis of complexity of various problems of belief revision. The
      computational complexity of various deduction formalisms for modal logic is
      analyzed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-98-c.html">[Mas98]</A>, where new bounds for establishing
      decidability for modal logic K4 are also established.
      <P>As for point 2, the language DQL (Default Query Language) is proposed in
      <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-eite-gott-97.html">[CEG97]</A>, and both its expressive power and complexity
      are analyzed. DQL is based on the well-known non-monotonic formalism of
      "default logic". A language based on the non-monotonic formalism of
      "circumscription", which extends the well-known query language Datalog, is
      defined and analyzed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-palo-98.html">[CP98]</A>. The effects on the expressive
      power of a rule-based query language when integrated with a description logic
      knowledge base are investigated in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-palo-lenz-97.html">[CPL98]</A>.
      <P>As for point 3, a first contribution to this technique, which splits theorem
      proving into a preprocessing phase (off-line reasoning), and a query answering
      phase (on-line reasoning), is a survey on the most recent advances of the field
      <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-doni-98.html">[CD98]</A>. An extensive analysis of the benefits that
      preprocessing a non-monotonic (in particular, circumscriptive) knowledge base
      may have on the complexity of reasoning is performed in
      <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-97-c.html">[CDSS97]</A>, carrying out a specific investigation on the
      effects on the size of data structures that the logical compilation produces.





The paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-98.html">[Lib98]</A> contains the results of an investigation on how
preprocessing may be useful for many problems from different fields, such as
diagnosis, and reasoning about actions. Specific formal tools, such as
complexity classes and reductions, for capturing the intuitive idea of a
"compilable" and "non-compilable" problem are proposed in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-97-d.html">[CDLS97]</A>.
<P>As for point 4, the results of an extensive experimental analysis are shown
in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-giov-scha-97.html">[CGS97]</A>. The analysis concerns the so called
"quantified boolean formulae", which provide prototypical problems for many
complexity classes extremely relevant to Knowledge Representation. For the
evaluation of such formulae an algorithm has been designed and implemented
in C++. The algorithm is described in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-giov-scha-98.html">[CGS98]</A>.
<P>Further extensive experimental studies on the traditional benchmark on
random CNF of fixed size and the industrial benchmarks of IFIP for hardware
verification are shown in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-d.html">[Mas97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-e.html">[Mas97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-98-b.html">[Mas98]</A>. The
analysis concerns the effect of embedding constraint propagation techniques
into traditional tableaux systems and their comparative advantage over
analytic cut.
<P>As for point 5, the paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-97-f.html">[Mas97a]</A> advocates the
introduction of approximate proofs within automated deduction for
propositional logic to overcome the computational barriers that make
deduction unfeasible in practice. The notion of approximate proofs is the
proof-theoretic dual of the notions of approximate semantics for tractable
reasoning developed by Dalal and Schaerf & Cadoli.
<P>The so-called Horn-approximations, previously defined by other authors,
are analyzed from the semantical and computational point of view in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-scarc-97.html">[CS97]</A>. In particular, relations with non-monotonic
reasoning are highlighted, and the cost of obtaining approximations is
evaluated.



<P><h2>Knowledge-Based Architectures for Planning and Scheduling</h2>


<P>The work concerns the realization of flexible architectures for solving
planning and scheduling problems, where an user can actively partecipate to
the solving process. The research has been focussed on three main aspects
involved in the design of such architectures: first, the realization of specialized
constraint management modules, which are the "basic layer" of the constraint
satisfaction approach used as automatic solving method; second, the definition
of a set of scheduling heuristic algorithms for solving different classes of
problems; third, the design of a user interaction modules to support a
collaborative problem solving modality between the users and the automated
system.





<P><h5>Specialized reasoning on time and resource constraints.</h5>
<P>In this research the problem of efficient dynamic support to problem
solving activities has been developed through the design and realization of
specialized reasoners for classes of constraints dealing with temporal and
resource representation.
<P>Research on quantitative temporal networks without disjunctive constraints
(the so-called Simple Temporal Problem) has concerned the syntesis of
dynamic management algorithms to be coupled with incremental constraint
posting approaches to problem solving. In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cest-oddi-97.html">[CO97]</A> a basic
algorithm for incremental propagation of a new time constraint is improved
giving a sufficient condition for inconsistency based on cycle detection in the
shortest paths graph. Moreover, properties for dynamic constraint retraction
from a consistent situation are considered and exploited in a constraint
management primitive.
<P>The problem of resource reasoning in planning has been addressed and seen
as integrated with temporal reasoning by defining a Time and Resource
Problem (T RP) in which the two kinds of constraints are considered. In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cest-stel-97.html">[CS97]</A> two filtering techniques for partial propagation of
resource constraints have been proposed that synthesize necessary additional
temporal constraints. During problem solving the current resource utilization
is computed and the "profile propagation" technique synthesizes quantitative
temporal constraints, while the "order propagation" technique synthesizes
qualitative ordering constraints between activities.
<P><h5>Scheduling Algorithms.</h5> A set of solution methods are proposed for
solving scheduling problems with different hypothesis on the type of temporal
constraints involved, the tightness of the problem and the resources capacity.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/oddi-smit-97.html">[OS97]</A> the use of stochastic variable and value
ordering heuristics for solving job shop scheduling problems with non-relaxable
deadlines and complex metric constraints is investigated. Previous research in
constraint satisfaction scheduling has developed highly effective, deterministic
heuristics for this class of problems based on simple measures of temporal
sequencing flexibility. However, they are not infallible, and the possibility of
search failure raises the issue of how to most productively enlarge the search.
This work designs an iterative sampling procedure, based on the intuition that
it is more productive to deviate from heuristic advice in cases where the
heuristic is less informed, and likewise better to follow the heuristic in cases
where it is more knowledgeable. Stochastic counterparts to previously
developed search heuristics are specified, which are parameterized to calibrate
degree of randomness to level of discriminatory power.
<P>The work <A HREF="/~ai/citations/oddi-97.html">[Odd97]</A> proposes an alternative method to solve the
same class of scheduling problems addressed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/oddi-smit-97.html">[OS97]</A>. An
incomplete backtracking strategy is evaluated in the so called phase transition
region. In this region, a problem changes form being solvable to being not
solvable and it is reasonable to conjecture that problems in that region are the





hardest ones. The design of the incomplete backtracking procedure is based on
the intuition that it is more productive to deviate from the sistematic
chronological backtracking search in cases where the heuristic is more
knowledgeable, and likewise better to follow the sistematic search when
heuristic is less informed. Experimental results on job shop scheduling
problems of increasing size demonstrate comparative advantage over complete
chronological backtracking.
<P>A different work <A HREF="/~ai/citations/oddi-cest-97.html">[OC97]</A> has concerned the Relaxable
Metric Scheduling Problem (RM SP ) in which the classical job-shop scheduling
problem is extended with the use of complex temporal metric constraints and
with the possibility of distinguishing between relaxable and not-relaxable
constraints. The paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a tabu search
procedure to improve a previously created heuristic solution to the RM SP .
The tabu procedure uses the idea of relaxing some temporal constraints to
"navigate" the search space and to find a solution. In particular, it tries to
produce either a solution where there are no relaxations or a solution where
only the constraints classified as relaxable are violated. Experimental results
on scheduling problems of increasing size demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed approach.
<P>All the previously CSP scheduling models have assumed a rather general
representations of temporal constraints (the Simple Temporal Problem), but
has restricted attention to problems that require allocation of unit-capacity
resources. Further research,
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cest-oddi-smit-98.html">[COS98a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/cest-oddi-smit-98b.html">[COS98b]</A>, has
concerned an extended class of scheduling problems where resources have
capacity to simultaneously support more than one activity, and resource
availability at any point in time is consequently a function of whether
sufficient unallocated capacity remains.
<P>The paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cest-oddi-smit-98.html">[COS98a]</A> presents a progression of
algorithms for solving such multiple-capacitated scheduling problems, and
evaluates the performance of each with respect to problem solving ability and
quality of the generated solutions. A previously reported algorithm, named
Conflict Free Solution Algorithm (CFSA), is first evaluated against a set of
problems of increasing dimension and shown to be of limited effectiveness.
Two variations of this algorithm are then introduced which incorporate
measures of temporal flexibility as an alternative heuristic basis for directing
the search, and the variant making broadest use of these search heuristics is
shown to yield significant performance improvement. Observations about the
tendency of the CFSA solution approach to produce unnecessarily
overconstrained solutions then lead to development of a second heuristic
algorithm, named Early Start Time Algorithm (ESTA). ESTA is shown to be
the most effective of the set, both in terms of its ability to efficiently solve
problems of increasing scale and its ability to produce schedules that minimize
overall completion time while retaining solution robustness.





 <P>The work <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cest-oddi-smit-98b.html">[COS98b]</A> compares two different solution
 approaches for the multiple capacitated metric scheduling problem: (1) a
 "profile-based procedure" which relies on local analysis of potential resource
 conflicts to heuristically direct the problem solving process, and (2) a
 "clique-based procedure" which exploits a global analysis of resource conflicts
 at greater computational cost. In each case, improvements are made to
 previously proposed techniques. Performance results are given on a series of
 problems of increasing scale and constrainedness, indicating the relative
 strengths of each procedure.
 <P><h5>Complete architectures that interact with the user.</h5> The research
 issues introduced above contribute to improve the performance of two
 complete architectures devoted to develop interactive systems for planning and
 scheduling applications.
 <P>In O-OSCAR (Object-Oriented Scheduling Architecture)
 <A HREF="/~ai/citations/bazz-caso-cest-97.html">[BCC97]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/cest-bazz-caso-97.html">[CBC97]</A> a careful
 object-oriented design has allowed to create a problem solving framework that
 (a) allows the insertion of specialized modules in which the efficiency of the
 implementation is particularly accurate; (b) can be re-configured for different
 specific applications by adding domain heuristics and user-oriented interfaces.
 An application to a quite relevant space problem, the scheduling of a
 data-relay satellite system, has been developed by specializing O-OSCAR to
 interact with two classes of specialized users in a work environment.
 <P>The I-S  (Interactive Scheduler) prototype is instead devoted to the
 experimentation of different interaction modalities with an expert user. This
 architecture is a first step in the development of a "mixed-initiative" problem
 solving framework in which the user and the system contribute in the solution
 of a scheduling problem. In particular the solution strategies described in
 <A HREF="/~ai/citations/oddi-cest-97.html">[OC97]</A> are connected with a rich interaction module that
 allows the user to interact with the current solution at different levels of
 responsibility.

 <h2>Constraint Reasoning and Scheduling</h2>


 <P>Constraint programming and constraint solving are prominent fields in
 Artificial Intelligence. We specifically investigated to what extent constraint
 programming techniques can be useful for solving various real-case scheduling
 problems, like timetabling. In particular, we worked in four different
 directions.
 <P><OL>
<LI> We developed implementations for solution of real cases of scheduling
     problems using conventional programming languages. The research
     regards the solution of large scale timetabling problems using local search
     techniques and, in particular, tabu search. Such research involves the
     definition of a standard formulation of the problem <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha97.html">[Sch97]</A>,





     the representation of both the search space and the neighborhood relation,
     and the implementation of the search procedures <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha97b.html">[Sch97a]</A>.
     In addition, in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha97c.html">[Sch97]</A> we propose a solution technique for
     scheduling and constraint satisfaction problems that combines
     backtracking-free constructive methods and local search techniques. Our
     technique incrementally constructs the solution, performing a local search
     on partial solutions each time the construction reaches a dead-end.

<LI> We developed tools and implementations for the solution of real cases of
     scheduling problems using existing constraint languages. We worked on
     the use of the Constraint Logic Programming language ECLiP Se for the
     solution of the above mentioned problems <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha97d.html">[Sch97b]</A>.

<LI> We are working on the extension of the theoretical framework of the
     constraint programming paradigm so as to embed some features that can
     be useful for modeling scheduling problems <A HREF="/~ai/citations/ApSc97.html">[AS97]</A>. This
     research led to the development of the language Alma-0 that extends the
     imperative language Modula-2 with logic programming features
     <A HREF="/~ai/citations/ABPS97.html">[ABPS97]</A>.

<LI> In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-lenz-scha-97.html">[CLS97]</A> we propose the use of an object-oriented
     framework in C++ as a general purpose tool for the solution of
     combinatorial search problems. In particular, we define a hierarchy of
     abstract classes for the various solution methods (e.g. backtracking, tabu
     search). The concrete classes defined by the user for the solution of the
     specific problems inherit the methods that implement the general solution
     algorithm, so that they must provide only the specific features of the
     problem under consideration.
     This architecture provides an adequate modularization for the solution of
     search problems, and it gives the user a clean conceptual schema of
     her/his application, thus facilitating the design and debugging phases.
 <P></OL>



 <P><h2>Natural language processing</h2>


 <P>During 1997 a collaboration with the IRST (Istituto per la Ricerca
 Scientifica e Tecnologica) and with Finsiel SpA on themes related to natural
 language processing has been continued. This collaboration was centered on
 theoretical and technological issues related to the automatic generation of
 hypertextual descriptions from conceptual models. This work was motivated
 by the consideration that while conceptual model validation is crucial in the
 information system development process, it may be difficult to accomplish if
 the domain expert is not acquainted with the formal language used by the
 analyst. Textual natural-language descriptions of the model are often suitable
 for this purpose, and valuable analyst time could be saved if these texts could
 be produced automatically: the combination of natural language and





hypertext significantly lowers the communicative barrier between the analyst
and the domain expert, thus increasing validation effectiveness. In this frame,
an experimental prototype called SAX <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Cancedda-et-al-97.html">[CKPP97a]</A>
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/Cancedda-et-al-97b.html">[CKPP97b]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/Cancedda-et-al-98.html">[CKPP98]</A> has been
realized and will serve as a basis for the development of a fully-fledged system.
The prototype is based on a hybrid approach, with a text planner based on
recursive expansion of communicative schemata for the general organization of
the text and a superficial module supporting flexible templates for
sentence-level generation. This solution achieves the desired trade-off between
robustness and portability across domains on one side and text fluency on the
other.
