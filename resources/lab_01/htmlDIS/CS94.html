                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>We   propose   a
                   technique for dealing with the high complexity of reasoning under  propositional  default  logic  and  circumscription.  The  technique is based on the notion of approximation:  A logical consequence relation is computed by means of sound and progressively
                   "more complete" relations, as well as complete and progressively
                   "more sound" ones. Both sequences generated in this way converge to the original consequence relation and are easier to compute. Moreover they are given a clear semantics based on multivalued logic. With this tecnique unsoundness and incompleteness
                   are introduced ina controlled way and precisely characterized.<p>
