We present an integrated system for knowledge representation, called AL-log,
based on description logics and the deductive database language Datalog.
AL-log embodies two subsystems, called structural and relational.  The former
allows for the definition of structural knowledge about classes of interest
(concepts) and membership relation between objects and classes.  The latter
allows for the definition of relational knowledge about objects described in the
structural component.  The interaction between the two components is
obtained by allowing constraints within Datalog clauses, thus requiring the
variables in the clauses to range over the set of instances of a specified concept.
We propose a method for query answering in AL-log based on constrained
resolution, where the usual deduction procedure defined for Datalog is
integrated with a method for reasoning on the structural knowledge.
