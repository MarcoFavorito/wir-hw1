<P>
The idea that knowledge can be used for finding information through
the network has been developed in several directions. However, most
proposals keep the knowledge about the information separate from
the access methods. This has the advantage of making it possible
the development of systems that can gather information from different 
sources, but it requires a mapping from the representation structures
into methods to access information on the network which is
accomplished by ad hoc procedures.
On the other hand, the information that we access through the browsers
is organized into structures that are coded in terms of
the content of each page and of its relationship to other pages.
Such structures typically guide humans in the search for a specific information.
Our idea is to use this kind of structural information to build 
knowledge based tools for the access to the network. 
More specifically, we are working at a system which acquires information
on a subject matter by extracting from the pages an explicit representation
of the underlying structure, and use it to answer user's requests by directly
pointing to the page containing the desired answer.
</P>

<P>
There are three building blocks of our proposal: a mechanism for 
representing Web pages  in terms
of description logics, a method for learning the structure of the pages
 available in the network on a specific topic,
a technique for generating a plan, as a sequence of links,
that leads to a page satisfying a user request.
</P>

Description logics </A> [4] have been developed in the last years with
the aim of formalizing terminological systems
that have been developed after KL-ONE. Such systems are
based on the idea of representing knowledge by building
hierarchical structures, sometimes called terminologies,
where the descriptions of interest are classified according
to their properties. The basic elements of the representation are
called <I>concepts</I> and <I>roles</I>,
which denote classes and binary relations, respectively. 
This general scheme is specialized in our framework according to the 
following ontology:
<UL>
<LI> the structure of a page is regarded as a concept description and a
specific Web page as an instance of a concept;</LI>
<LI> each page has static properties, which are represented as roles
and refer to any kind of information that can be relevant to both
the page structure and its content;</LI>
<LI> each page has dynamic properties, which are also represented as
roles, and are represented as actions, in the sense that they allow 
jumping to other pages.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Regarding the learning method, the extraction of information from the sources
relies both on the ability to represent the syntactic structure
of the documents (description logics can be effectively used to
characterize SGML documents [1]) and on the processing textual information
in order to identify names for the links and other static properties
such as, for example, page title.
The information acquired by the system is returned as
a set of training examples in a description logic. To support
the construction of a knowledge base, we use the method for
inductive learning proposed in [2]. In addition, we
are considering the extension of such method to
exploit the use of background knowledge during the learning process.
The result of the knowledge acquisition stage is a knowledge base containing
the concept descriptions that represent
the typical structure of the Web pages on the subject matter, together
with information about the initial addresses to navigate within
such structures.
</P>

<P>
Once the knowledge base is constructed, our system can accept requests 
from the user, concerning the subjects previously examined, and is
expected to return the page(s) satisfying the requests. This
is achieved by a two step process. The first step consists of finding
one or more plans (sequences of links) that lead to a page satisfying
the goal associated with the user request. The stecond step consists
in the execution of the plan, which may require the discovery of
failures and requests for replanning. The planning component of the system
relies on a special use of the procedural rules typically used in
description logic systems, that has been obtained by exploiting
the correspondence between description and dynamic logics.
The setting has been developed for planning the actions of a mobile
robot [3].
</P>

<P>
Therefore, our system, whose implementation is in progress,
is meant to act as an intelligent browser,
which allows the user to reach the requested information in a single step.
Learning and planning are essential underlying techniques for accomplishing
 such a task, and description logics are the bases for both 
the formalization and the implementation of several system components.
We believe that the main feature of our proposal is in the intrepretation
of the network structures available on the Web,
directly in terms of the representation structures used by the system
in order to provide reasoning facilities.
