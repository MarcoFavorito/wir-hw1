<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
The Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture is a famous conjecture stated in the
early sixties. It is known that a minimal counter example to this
conjecture would be a partitionable graph. In 1999, Boros, Gurvich and
Hougardy proved that a graph is partitionable if and only if it is
partitionable with respect to its maximum cliques, introducing thereby
the concept of partitionable families.
<p>
In this talk, we will focuse on "regular" partitionable families, that
is partitionable families given by near-factorizations of finite groups.
The characterization of near-factorization of cyclic groups is an open
problem for now more than fifteen years. Little is known about
near-factorizations of non-cyclic groups: we will present a software
designed to look for near-factorizations in any finite group of small
order. Computations revealed the smallest and first group with
near-factorizations, which is not cyclic and not dihedral.
