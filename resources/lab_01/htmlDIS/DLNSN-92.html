We investigate the use of epistemic operators in the framework of concept
languages (also called terminological languages). The results of this work have
a twofold significance. From the point of view of epistemic logics, our
contribution is to have identified an effective procedure for the problem of
answering epistemic queries posed to a knowledge base expressed in the
concept language ALC  . From the point of view of concept languages, the most
relevant aspect of our work is that we have reconstructed in logic several
common features of existing knowledge representation systems. Epistemic
operators provide a highly expressive query language; allow for the treatment
of several database features, such as closed world reasoning and integrity
constraints; and finally can give a formal characterization of some procedural
mechanisms, such as trigger rules, usually considered in frame-based systems.
