                   Satellite System (DRS) is intended to provide communication services between low earth orbiting satellites and their ground terminals. DRS scheduling is a potentially complex task which would
                   greatly benefit from an optimized resource management. The paper describes a knowledge-based system,  DRS-Sched,  aimed at
                   solving a noticeable aspect of the DRS scheduling problem. DRSSched combines both predictive and reactive scheduling heuristics
                   in quite an original way.<p>
