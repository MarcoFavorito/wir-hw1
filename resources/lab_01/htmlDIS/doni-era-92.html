We evaluate the technique of most specific concepts in knowledge bases when
dealing with incomplete information. The two forms of incomplete information
we consider are existential quantification and disjunction. The languages we
use to express the knowledge base are concept languages, a well studied family
of languages stemmed from KL-ONE. The result of our analysis is that most
specific concepts are still useful when dealing with existential quantification,
while they are no more convenient in presence of disjunction. The result is
significant since present knowledge base systems, such as BACK, do not use
this technique when dealing with indefinite knowledge.
