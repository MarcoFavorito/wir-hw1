<H1>Planning with sensing in a mobile robot</H1>

<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>We present an attempt to reconcile the theoretical work on reasoning
about action with the realization of agents, in particular mobile robots.
Specifically, we present a logical framework for representing dynamic systems
based on description logics, which allows for the formalization of sensing
actions. We address the generation of conditional plans by defining a suitable
reasoning method in which a plan is extracted from a constructive proof
of a query expressing a given goal. We also present an implementation of
such a logical framework, which has been tested on the mobile robot ``Tino''.
