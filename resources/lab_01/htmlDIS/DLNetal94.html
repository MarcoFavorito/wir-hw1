                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Concept
                   languages have been studied in order to give a formal account of
                   the basic features of frame-based languages. The focus of research
                   in concept languages was initially on the semantical reconstruction of frame-based systems and the computational complexity
                   of reasoning. More recently, attention has been paid to the formalization  of  other  aspects  of  frame-based  languages,  such  as
                   non-monotonic reasoning and procedural rules, which are necessary in order to bring concept languages closer to implemented
                   systems. In this paper we discuss the above issues in the framework of concept languages enriched with an epistemic operator.<p>
                   In  particular,  we  show  that  the  epistemic  operator  both  introduces novel features in the language, such as sophisticated query
                   formulation and closed world reasoning, and makes it possible to
                   provide  a  formal  account  for  some  aspects  of  the  existing  systems, such as rules and definitions, that cannot be characterized
                   in a standard first-order framework.<p>
