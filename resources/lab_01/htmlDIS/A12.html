  This paper describes how hypermedia instruction manuals can be generated
  from discourse plan: intentional and rhetorical knowledge in the plan tree
  are employed to construct the hypermedia elements, to assemble them into
  pages and to introduce links among them. Plan tree transformation
  functions are defined so as to ensure that generated hypermedia respect
  interface usability and Web design criteria. User adaptation is perfomed by
  parametrizing these functions: this method enables building the hypermedia
  according to a dynamic assessment of the user needs.
