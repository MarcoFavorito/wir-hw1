Several studies about computational complexity of non-monotonic reasoning
(NMR) showed that non-monotonic inference is significantly harder than
classical, monotonic inference. This contrasts with the general idea that NMR
can be used to make knowledge representation and reasoning simpler, not
harder. In this paper we show that, to some extent, NMR fulfills the
representation goal. In particular, we prove that non-monotonic formalisms
such as circumscription and default logic allow for a much more compact and
natural representation of propositional knowledge than propositional calculus.
Proofs are based on a suitable definition of a compilable inference problem,
and on non-uniform complexity classes. Some results about intractability of
circumscription and default logic can therefore be interpreted as the price one
has to pay for having such an extra-compact representation. On the other
hand, intractability of inference and compactness of representation are not
equivalent notions: we exhibit intractable non-monotonic formalisms whose
non-monotonic assumptions are representable by few propositional formulae.
Finally, sometimes NMR really makes reasoning simpler. We present
prototypical scenarios where closed-world reasoning and well-founded
semantics account for a faster, complete and unsound approximation of



classical reasoning.
