The process of integrating knowledge coming from different
sources has been widely investigated in the literature.   Three
distinct conceptual approaches to this problem have been most
succesful:   belief revision, merging and update.   In this paper
we present a framework that integrates these three approaches.
In the proposed framework all three operations can be performed.
We provide an example that can only be solved by applying more
than one single style of knowledge integration and, therefore,
cannot be addressed by anyone of the approaches alone.   The
framework has been implemented, and the examples shown in this
paper (as well as other examples from the belief revision
literature) have been successfully tested.
