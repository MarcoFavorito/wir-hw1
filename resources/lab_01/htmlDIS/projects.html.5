        Title: <i><b>e-Cookbook</b></i><br>
        Goal: A Web-based user interface that provides an avenue to information
        on how to prepare various delicacies.<br>
        Tools: WebRatio, Microsoft FrontPage, a scripting language<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>m-Cookbook</b></i><br>
        Goal: An effort that realizes a user interface that provides an avenue
        to information on how to prepare various delicacies through a mobile
        device (e.g., cellphone, PDA).<br>
        [Option: The application need not be Web-based.]<br>
        Tools: J2ME Wireless Toolkit, XHTML, a scripting language<br>

        <br>
        Title: <b><i>MetaNews Service</i></b><br>
        Goal: The realization of a user interface that enables the user to have
        access to news. The MetaNews Service does not inherently have any news.
        It relies on other news sources i.e. it samples news from news sources
        (such as CNN, Reuters, BBC, ABC News, etc). Students are free to use RSS
        (Really Simple Syndication).<br>

        Title: <b><i>e-Class Directory</i></b><br>
        Goal: A Web-based user interface through which the user can browse and
        find students' contacts. The user interface provides both visual (e.g.,
        photo of the student) and audio information (e.g., a brief message of
        introduction/greetings by the student).<br>

        Title: <i><b>Class Directory</b></i><br>
        Goal: A user interface through which the user can browse and find
        students' contacts. The user interface provides both visual (e.g., photo
        of the student) and audio information (e.g., a brief message of
        introduction/greetings by the student). However, the user interface
        should be developed as a standalone application.<br>
        Tools: Java<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>UCD_Tutor</b></i><br>
        Goal: A Web-based e-learning module introducing User-Centered Design
        principles. The e-learning module should have several types of learning
        content such as text, images, etc.<br>
        Tools: Flash, Microsoft FrontPage, a scripting language<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>Eva_Tutor</b></i><br>
        Goal: A Web-based e-learning module for teaching Evaluation techniques.
        The e-learning module should provide several types of learning content
        such as text, images, etc.<br>
        Tools: Flash, Microsoft FrontPage, a scripting language<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>Wishlister</b></i> (mobile, PC/mobile interaction)<br>
        Goal: The application gives the opportunity to build various lists of
        interesting products (books, CDs, DVDs, etc.) organized by user defined
        wishlists. The idea is that the user should be able to browse a site
        like Amazon.com and add elements to a whatever user defined list in
        order to use it later for various purposes. Note: the Amazon API (freely
        available) could be exploited in order to build a prototype that does
        the real thing. The project can be assigned as a composite project to
        two groups (one PC, one mobile)<br>
        Tools: Dreamweaver, WebRatio, XHTML (mobile)<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>Annotated Bib Manager</b></i><br>
        Goal: A tool to create a manage annotated bibliographies. The user
        should be able to construct various sets of bibliographies organized by
        user defined topics and eventually extract bibtex versions of these
        lists to be used while writing papers.<br>
        Tools: Java (PC version) or WebRatio, a scripting language (web version)<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>J_TV User Interface</b></i><br>
        Goal: A user interface through which the viewer can have access to
        various typical TV services. A TV channel can be simulated by using an
        appropriate representative animated image/video file. The user interface
        should be developed as a standalone application.<br>
        Tools: Java<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>F_TV User Interface</b></i><br>
        Goal: A user interface through which the viewer can have access to
        various typical TV services. A TV channel can be simulated by using an
        appropriate representative animated image/video file. The user interface
        should be developed as a standalone application.<br>
        Tools: Macromedia Flash</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Title: <i><b>e-Cinema</b></i><br>
        Goal: To create a website to find films/cinemas in your city (e.g.,
        Roma). The user should be able to find cinemas and films by following
        various strategies (looking for a specific film, cinema in the
        neighborhoods, by price, etc.). The main challenge is to make it simple.
        Actually there are many sites providing this service but they are all
        very, very unusable. So the main effort would be to do a deep analysis
        of current systems and understand why they do not work, what are the
        tasks that users really need to perform and design a simple interface.<br>
        Tools: WebRatio, Dreamweaver, Scripting languages<br>
        ('Bad') Example: http://www.35mm.it/&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        Title: <b><i>Meeting Room Reservation</i></b><br>
        Goal: To manage the reservation of meeting room(s) (e.g., C2 at DIS
        department). The users should be able to control the time schedule and
        do some tasks like: controlling who has reserved the room, reserving a
        room, asking the owner of a reservation to exchange the reservation,
        etc. The system must be flexible enough to permit very fast and safe
        changes. It would also be nice to have automatic notices delivered to
        interested persons.<br>
        Tools: Java (PC version), WebRatio (Web version), Flash<br>
        Note: If the final prototype would be good enough, it could be really
        used at DIS!<br>
        <br>
        Title: <i><b>e-Grocery</b></i><br>
        Goal: An application that enables the user to prepare shopping lists at
        home and then use them on the PDA while in a supermarket. The user
        should be able to load predefined lists and then change them according
        to his/her needs. It should also be easy to transfer a given list to a
        PDA and use it during shopping activity.<br>
        Tools: Java (PC version), WebRatio (Web version), Flash<br>
        Notes: This can be developed by two groups. One group could develop the
        PC version to build and manage the lists. The other group could develop
        the PDA version to use during shopping.<br>
        Useful resources: CHI 2003 paper: &quot;Mobile computing in the retail

        </font><b><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Basic Requirements
        for Each of the Projects</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
        - Study the current situation and what is needed (Gathering/Collecting
        requirements) i.e. observe what the users do, what they say, the
        artifacts &amp; documents they create and/or use; ask the users; etc.<br>
        - Analyze the gathered information and organize it i.e. task analysis.
        (Typical questions: who are the users of the system?, what tasks do they
        currently perform?, what tasks are desired?, how are the tasks learned?,
        where are the tasks performed?, how often are tasks performed?, what are
        the time constraints on the tasks? what is the relationship between the
        user and data?, what happens when things go wrong?, etc.) The students
        should also consider exploiting methods such as scenarios.<br>
        - Progressively and iteratively, carry out UI design coupled with
        evaluation studies. <a href="http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~kimani/groups.html">Teams</a>
        will carry out evaluation studies among themselves.<br>
        - Ultimately, each <a href="http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~kimani/groups.html">team</a>
        should realize a final working prototype/product.<br>
        - Continual and regular feedback will be expected from student and team
        in the entire process of the project.&nbsp;<br>
        - Each <a href="http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~kimani/groups.html">team</a>
        has a responsibility to submit both the final working prototype/product
        (on diskette/CD) and a corresponding tesina report (also on the same
        diskette/CD). The submission should be done before sitting for the final
        HCI examination.<br>
        The tesina report could have the following organization:<br>
        [1. Introduction,&nbsp;<br>
        2. Background knowledge,&nbsp;<br>
        3. Your work and results<br>
        (gathering requirements, analysis, design, prototyping &amp; iteration,
        final working prototype/product)<br>
        with<br>
        3. Usability evaluations carried all through,&nbsp;<br>
        4. Future work,&nbsp;<br>
        5. Conclusions,&nbsp;<br>
        6. References.]<br>
