                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Since the earliest
                   formalisation  of  default  logic  by  Reiter  many  contributions  to
                   this  appealing  approach  to  nonmonotonic  reasoning  have  been
                   given. The different formalisations are here presented in a general
                   framework that gathers the basic notions, concepts and constructions underlying default logic. Our view is to interpret defaults
                   as special rules that impose a restriction on the juxtaposition of
                   monotonic Hilbert-style proofs of a given logic _L. We propose to
                   describe  default  logic  as  a  logic  where  the  juxtaposition  of  default  proofs  is  subordinate  to  a  restriction  condition   .  Hence
                   a default logic is a pair (_L;  ) where properties of the logic  _L,
                   like compactness, can be interpreted through the restriction condition   .  Different  default  systems  are  then  given  a  common
                   characterization through a specific condition on the logic _L. We
                   also  prove  cumulativity  for  any  default  logic  (_L;  )  by  slightly
                   modifying  the  notion  of  default  proof.  We  extend,  in  fact,  the
                   language of _L in a way close to that followed by Brewka in the
                   formulation of his cumulative default system. Finally we show the
                   existence of infinitely many intermediary default logics, depending on   and called linear logics, which "lie in between" Reiter's
                   and Lukaszewicz' versions of default logic.<p>
