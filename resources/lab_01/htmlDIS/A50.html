  Roles may be analyzed in many ways: as "abstract agents"; as power
  positions; as sets of obligations; etc. For sure one of the main facets of roles
  is their Delegation-Adoption nature. This is exactly the perspective we
  assume here: it is a partial view of roles, but a fundamental one. In this
  paper we try to analyze a role just as a special kind of task-delegation, or
  contract. We recapitulate the various levels of delegation and adoption
  (help), characterizing their basic principles and representations on the basis
  of a theory of plans, actions and agents. Then we show how delegation
  creates roles as well as delegation creates tasks. However, once roles exist
  they constraint also task delegation among agents. We examine also this
  dialectics between role and task delegation.
