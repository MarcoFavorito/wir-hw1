The Congress of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence represents,
at the italian level, the most important meeting point for all persons involved
in the various areas of AI.<BR>
The fifth Congress will include invited relations of international
 experts,
presentation of scientific works, demos of systems and prototypes, round tables
 about relevant methodological and applicative aspects, tutorials of national
 experts, student projects and other satellite events.
During the last two days, at the same time of the Congress sessions,
 two workshops of more applicative nature will be held.<P>

Workshops
</B></FONT><P>

<font size=4>
Workshops are a recent addition in the Congress program, and they are
already a useful chance of meeting and discussion among researchers and
professionals. In addition, their aim is to verify the contributes that
Artificial Intelligence can bring in specific contexts.<BR>
This year both workshops will focus on crucial sectors of today world,
as are services for citizens and financial services.
The titles are:

<UL>
<LI>Artificial Intelligence in financial institutions (September 17)<BR>
	(Organized by: C. Rossignoli, C. Ficini)

<P>
<LI>Artificial Intelligence, new technologies and services for the citizen (September 19)<BR>
	(Organized by: R. Petrioli, D. D'Aloisi, P. Naggar, G. Soda)
</UL>


Each workshop will last a whole day, in parallel with the
technical/scientific/applicative sessions. Due to the specific nature
of these events, the participation is open also to people who are not
registered for the Congress.
