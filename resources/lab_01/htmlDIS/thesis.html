<H1>Autoepistemic Description Logics</H1>

<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>The goal of the thesis is to reconcile theory and practice of terminological
KR systems, by defining a non-first-order extension of Description Logics
which is able both to formalize the nonmonotonic features of such systems,
and to provide a computational characterization of reasoning in such a
setting.</P>

<P>In order to identify a proper nonmonotonic extension of Description
Logics, we investigate in detail the minimal knowledge paradigm and its
relationship with nonmonotonic modal logics and logic programming. Hence,
the results presented in the thesis can be divided into two parts: </P>

<OL>
<LI>first, we provide a study of epistemic logics of minimal knowledge,
in order to better understand the epistemological and computational implications
of the minimal knowledge paradigm and of the various formalizations based
on such principle;</LI>

<LI>then, we exploit these results in order to provide an appropriate logical
reconstruction of non-first-order aspects of structured KR systems.</LI>
</OL>

<P>As for the first of the two points above, we start by studying a family
of nonmonotonic formalisms called <I>ground logics</I>, which can be considered
as obtained through a ``generalization'' of the principle of minimal knowledge.
We analyze both the semantical and the computational properties of such
logics. </P>

<P>The results obtained for ground logics allow us to analyze in more detail
the relationship between minimal knowledge and the realm of epistemic logics,
both from the computational and the epistemological viewpoint. In particular,
we show that the techniques used for reasoning in ground logics can be
adapted to solve the deduction problem in several other epistemic formalisms,
among which Levesque's logic of only knowing. Moreover, we investigate
the relationship between ground logics and McDermott and Doyle's nonmonotonic
modal logics.</P>

<P>Finally, we exploit the relationship between minimal knowledge and logic
programming in the development of deduction methods for the logic MBNF.
In particular, we show that the techniques used for reasoning in ground
logics can be extended in order to solve the deduction problem in the propositional
fragment of MBNF, thus providing a computational characterization for
MBNF in the propositional case. Moreover, we further analyze the relationship
between MBNF and Moore's autoepistemic logic. In particular, we show
that negative introspection in autoepistemic logic <I>exactly</I> corresponds
to negation as failure in MBNF. </P>

<P>As for the second point, we first define the family of Autoepistemic
Description Logics, which corresponds to the nonmonotonic modal extension
of Description Logics based on the logic MBNF. </P>

<P>We study reasoning in Autoepistemic Description Logics, providing deductive
methods for several classes of such formalisms.</P>

<P>We also show that the expressive abilities of these logics allow for
the reconstruction of the nonmonotonic features of KR systems: defaults,
procedural rules, epistemic queries, integrity constraints, role and concept
closure. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between Autoepistemic
Description Logics and hybrid systems combining DATALOG and structured
representations of knowledge: first, by giving an epistemic semantics for
such systems; then, by extending such systems with negation and disjunction
in the rules, also providing deduction methods for these extensions.</P>

<P>Finally, we study the problem of representing actions in Autoepistemic
Description Logics. In particular, starting from the correspondence between
Description Logics and Propositional Dynamic Logics, we define a theoretical
framework for reasoning about actions based on an autoepistemic description
logic. Moreover, we present an implementation of such a framework through
a knowledge representation system based on DLs, namely the system \classic.
We also show that our framework is well-suited for representing sensing
actions. </P>
