Our algorithm finds a tree in which the degree     of each node $v$ is $O(B_v+\log n)$ and the total edge-cost is at most a constant     times the cost of any tree that obeys all degree constraints. The new algorithm     achieves similar guarantees as our previous result from STOC'00. The new algorithm     is direct in the sense that it does not need to solve an LP to compute the     approximate solution. The algorithm demonstrates the use of a novel hybri     between primal-dual and local-search algorithms. We will also outline how     the above can be extended to approximate minimum-cost degree-bounded Steiner     trees. A result which is to appear at FSTTCS '03.  <P>This is joint work with R.
