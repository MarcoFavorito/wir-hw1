Many variants of default logics exist.   Two of the main
differences among them are the choice between local or global
consistency and the choice of accepting maximally successful sets
of defaults.   Proving a result that is valid in all variants
amounts to showing either a proof that holds for all semantics or
a different proof for each semantics.   In this paper, we
characterize theories that do not depend at all on what makes the
semantics different.   A result that is proved on such theories
holds not only for all considered semantics, but also on any
other semantics that differs on the classical one because of the
two choices.   These theories are also of interest for practical
applications of default logic, as an implemented system should be
able to detect (for example, to warn the user) any theory whose
semantics is debatable.
