  In this paper we face the problem of finding characteristic information
  about images of different objects, showing that the fractal encoding based
  on Iterated Function Systems, besides allowing very high compression rates,
  can be successfully applied also for capturing discriminatory features that
  can be exploited for non-fractal image classification. An original feature
  extraction algorithm was developed and applied to encode the hand-written
  digits data set. Then, different learning algorithms were applied and their
  performances were compared both to those obtained using a general purpose
  fractal encoder (enc by Fisher) and to the work done in the StatLog project
  on the same data set.
