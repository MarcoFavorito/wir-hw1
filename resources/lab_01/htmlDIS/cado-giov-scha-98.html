The high computational complexity of advanced reasoning tasks such as belief
revision and planning calls for efficient and reliable algorithms for reasoning
problems harder than NP. In this paper we propose Evaluate, an algorithm for
evaluating Quantified Boolean Formulae, a language that extends propositional
logic in a way such that many advanced forms of propositional reasoning, e.g.,
reasoning about knowledge, can be easily formulated as evaluation of a QBF.
Algorithms for evaluation of QBFs are suitable for the experimental analysis
on a wide range of complexity classes, a property not easily found in other
formalisms. Evaluate is based on a generalization of the Davis-Putnam
procedure for SAT, and is guaranteed to work in polynomial space. Before
presenting Evaluate, we discuss all the abstract properties of QBFs that we
singled out to make the algorithm more efficient. We also briefly mention the
main results of the experimental analysis, which is reported elsewhere.
