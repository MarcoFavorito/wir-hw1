The problem of modeling semi-structured data is important in many
application areas such as multimedia data management, biological databases,
digital libraries, and data integration. Graph schemas [Buneman&al. 1997]
have been proposed recently as a simple and elegant formalism for
representing semistructured data. In this model, schemas are represented as
graphs whose edges are labeled with unary formulae of a theory, and the
notions of conformance of a database to a schema and of subsumption between
two schemas are defined in terms of a simulation relation. Several authors
have stressed the need of extending graph schemas with various types of
constraints, such as edge existence and constraints on the number of outgoing
edges. In this paper we analyse the appropriateness of various knowledge
representation formalisms for representing and reasoning about graph schemas
extended with constraints. We argue that neither First Order Logic, nor Logic
Programming nor Frame-based languages are satisfactory for this purpose, and
present a solution based on very expressive Description Logics. We provide
algorithms and complexity analysis for the problem of deciding schema
subsumption and conformance in various interesting cases, that differ by the
expressive power in the specification of constraints.
