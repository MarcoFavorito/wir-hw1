Several studies about complexity of NMR showed that inferring in
non-monotonic knowledge bases is significantly harder than reasoning in
monotonic ones. This contrasts with the general idea that NMR can be used
to make knowledge representation and reasoning simpler, not harder. In this
paper we show that, to some extent, NMR has fulfilled its goal. In particular
we prove that circumscription allows for more compact and natural
representation of knowledge. Results about intractability of circumscription
can therefore be interpreted as the price one has to pay for having such an
extra-compact representation. On the other hand, sometimes NMR really
makes reasoning simpler; we give prototypical scenarios where closed-world
reasoning accounts for a faster and unsound approximation of classical
reasoning.
