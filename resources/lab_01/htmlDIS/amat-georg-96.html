Recent work in IR has been paying great attention to models which employ a
logical approach. Most of the logical models make use of probabilities or
similar belief functions in order to introduce the inductive component whereby
uncertainty is treated. We just reverse this point of view; first use the
numerical information, frequencies or probabilities, then define your own
logical consequence. More generally, we claim that retrieval is a form of
deduction. We introduce a simple but powerful logical framework of relevance
feedback, derived from the well founded area of nonmonotonic logic. This
description can help us evaluate, describe and compare from a theoretical
point of view previous approaches based on conditionals or probabilities.
