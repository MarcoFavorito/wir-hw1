                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Traditionally,
                   the core of a Terminological Knowledge Representation System
                   (TKRS) consists of a so-called TBox, where concepts are introduced,  and  an  ABox,  where  facts  about  individuals  are  stated
                   in terms of these concepts. This design has a drawback because
                   in  most  applications  the  TBox  has  to  meet  two  functions  at  a
                   time:  on the one hand, similar to a database schema, framelike
                   structures with typing information are introduced through primitive concepts and primitive roles;  on the other hand, views on
                   the objects in the knowledge base are provided through defined
                   concepts. We propose to account for this conceptual separation
                   by partitioning the TBox into two components for primitive and
                   defined concepts, which we call the schema  and the view  part.<p>
                   We envision the two parts to differ with respect to the language
                   for concepts, the statements allowed, and the semantics. We argue that by this separation we achieve more conceptual clarity
                   about the role of primitive and defined concepts and the semantics of terminological cycles. Moreover, three case studies show
                   the computational benefits to be gained from the refined architecture.<p>
