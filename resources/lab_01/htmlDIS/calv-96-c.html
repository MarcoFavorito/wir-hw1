The computational complexity of reasoning on pure concept expressions has
been characterized completely for all relevant description logics. On the
contrary, reasoning in the presence of schema axioms is not so well understood
and far from being settled completely. An important class of schemata is that
of primitive schemata (in which the schema axioms express only necessary
conditions) possibly containing cycles. In this paper we provide, for a relevant
class of description logics, a complete characterization of computational
complexity of reasoning in these types of schemata, both in the presence and
in the absence of cycles. The results are obtained by devising reasoning
procedures, establishing direct reductions to show lower bounds, and
introducing a general technique by which the constructor for existential
quantification can be removed without influencing the result of reasoning.
