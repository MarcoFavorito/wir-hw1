Logical Framework and Implementation </H1>

<H2> Abstract </H2>

The focus of current research in cognitive robotics is both on the
realization of systems based on known formal settings and on the extension
of previous formal approaches to account for features that play a
significant role for autonomous robots, but have not yet received an
adequate treatment.  In this paper we adopt a formal framework derived from
Propositional Dynamic Logics by exploiting their formal correspondence with
Description Logics, and present an extension of such a framework obtained
by introducing both concurrency on primitive actions and autoepistemic
operators for explicitly representing the robot's epistemic state. We show
that the resulting formal setting allows for the representation of actions
with context-dependent effects, sensing actions, and concurrent actions,
and address both the presence of exogenous events and the characterization
of the notion of executable plan in such a complex setting. Moreover, we
present an implementation of this framework in a system which is capable of
generating plans that are actually executed on mobile robots, and
illustrate the experimentation of such a system in the design and
implementation of soccer players for the 1999 Robocup competition.
