<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>We study the computational properties of the propositional fragment
of Levesque's logic of only knowing. In particular, we show that the problem
of reasoning with only knowing in the propositional case lies at the second
level of the polynomial hierarchy. Thus, it is as hard as reasoning in
the majority of propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning, like
default logic, circumscription and autoepistemic logic, and it is easier
than reasoning in propositional formalisms based on the minimal knowledge
paradigm, which is strictly related to the notion of only knowing. </P>
