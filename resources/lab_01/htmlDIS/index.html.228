<H3>Bio Scketch</H3>
Claudio De Persis received the Laurea degree summa cum laude in
Electronic Engineering and the Doctor of Research degree in
Systems Engineering in 1996 and, respectively, 2000 both from
Universit&agrave di Roma "La Sapienza", Rome, Italy.
He was a Research Associate at Washington University, St. Louis, MO, from
1999 to 2001, and at Yale University, New Haven, CT, from 2001 to 2002. Since
November 2002, he has been with the Department of Computer and Systems
Science at the University of Rome “La Sapienza” as an Assistant Professor.
He has held visiting positions at Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, and the
University of California, Davis (1998–1999). In 2004–2005, he was a Visiting
Scientist at the Center for Embedded Software Systems, Aalborg University,
Aalborg, Denmark. His current research interests include observation and control
with limited information, hybrid systems, monitoring in large-scale systems,
complex systems, networks, modern communication, and post-genomic
biology.
Dr. De Persis served on the IEEE Control Systems Society Conference Editorial
Board in 2004–2005.</P>
