						<blockquote>
							<p align="justify"><em>Group communication systems are an important and widely used tool for 
							building distributed applications. In fact they offer several services which help developers 
							in adding specific properties into their applications. Among these services, total order 
							multicast is a one-to-many communication primitive which can be used to ensure that destination 
							processes will deliver the same sequence of messages. However the precise guarantees that this 
							service enforces and the performance it gives can vary, as it can be implemented according to 
							different specifications and using different algorithms. These factors should guide developers 
							in the choice of a particular group toolkit to use in their applications. To simplify this task, 
							we analyze several group toolkits, highlighting the properties of their total order multicast 
							service, and we compare them from a performance point of view. Results are then used to select 
							the most suitable toolkit for the implementation of a particular service within the 
							Interoperable Replication Logic (IRL). IRL is a FT-CORBA compliant three-tier architecture for 
							software replication. Three-tier architectures for software replication interpose a middle-tier 
							between client and replicas. The middle-tier embeds the replication logic, i.e the set of protocols 
							and mechanisms used to implement a replication tecnique. In particular, the current IRL prototype 
							exploits three-tier active software replication to increase the availability of deterministic 
							stateful CORBA objects. According to the active replication tecnique, all replicas have to execute 
							requests in the same order. In this context, total order multicast is required to implement the 
							Sequencer Service, which is a middle-tier component used to define the order of client requests 
							execution.</em></p>
