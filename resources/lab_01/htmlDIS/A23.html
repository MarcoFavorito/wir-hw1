  This paper proposes a hierarchical organization of the linguistic knowledge,
  that views grammar as an abstraction of item-dependent information (in
  particular, an abstraction of subcategorization frames into a hierarchy of
  classes). The formalism has been successfully applied to a classification of
  105 Italian verbal frames, developed by analysing a corpus of about 500,000
  words. The proposed framework (expressed in a dependency approach) is of
  linguistic and computational interest. From a linguistic point of view, it is a
  clear, significant and non-redundant representation. From a computational
  point of view, structuring the grammar into a hierarchy allows to define a
  predictive component for parsing, exploiting the information at many levels
  of the hierarchy: this allows to reduce the ambiguity, a very big problem in
  large scale NLP systems.
