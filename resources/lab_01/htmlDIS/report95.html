<h2>Knowledge Representation</h2>

<P>The goal of this research is to study the foundations of a
logical approach to structured knowledge representation
languages, with regard to both the expressive power and the
computational properties of the associated reasoning
techniques.  The definition of knowledge bases by means of
structured knowledge representation languages is done by
specifying a terminological knowledge base (TBox), where
concepts are defined, along with an assertional knowledge
base (ABox), where facts about individuals are stated in
terms of these concepts.
<P>Research on description logics has systematically
investigated the problems of concept satisfiability and concept
subsumption (see the introductory survey
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/DLNS95.html">[DLNS95]</A>).  <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-95.html">[DG95a]</A> investigates
satisfiability and subsumption for a wide range of constructs
with regard to TBoxes of the most general form (no
restrictions on cycles).  In particular, the emphasis is on
extending the set of constructs, thus studying the edge of
decidability (instead of the edge of tractability).  This choice
is motivated by the observation that even for very simple
description logics, reasoning tasks that take into account
TBoxes are EXPTIME-hard.  The techniques adopted for
investigation are based on the correspondence between
description logics and propositional dynamic logics, and
several new results have been found in both fields.
<P>The study in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-95.html">[DG95a]</A> has lead to the
definition of an EXPTIME-decidable description logic with
constructs for specifying classes of aggregate objects
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lenz-95-IJCAI.html">[DGL95d]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lenz-95-DL.html">[DGL95b]</A>.  In such a logic it is possible to
denote classes of tuples (n-ary relations), subclasses, sets and
"key" attributes, in the spirit of object oriented models.  In
addition, the logic contains a controlled form of "role value
map".  The possibility of capturing object oriented models has
been further investigated in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-95.html">[CDL95]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-95-b.html">[CDL94]</A>.
<P><A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-95.html">[DG95a]</A> shows that inference procedures for
several description logics and propositional dynamic logics can
in fact be based on those for Converse Propositional Dynamic
Logic (CPDL). In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-96.html">[DG95b]</A> it is proven that it is
possible to eliminate the "converse" operator from the CPDL
without compromising the soundness and completeness of
inference for it.  Specifically a polynomial encoding of CPDL
formulae into basic propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is
presented, which eliminates converse programs from a PDL
formula but adds enough information so as not to destroy its
original meaning with respect to satisfiability, validity, and
logical implication.  As a consequence it is possible to build
inference procedures for CPDL by first encoding CPDL
formulae into PDL and then running inference procedures for
PDL, typically much more efficient in practical cases.
<P>The insights of <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-96.html">[DG95b]</A> have been used to
extend to CPDL tableaux-based inference procedures devised
for PDL. Indeed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-mass-96.html">[DGM96]</A> a prefixed
tableaux calculus for CPDL is developed, which is based on a
combination of different techniques such as prefixed tableaux
for modal logics and model checkers for mu-calculus.  The
calculus, naively worst-case NEXPTIME, can be transformed
into an EXPTIME algorithm (CPDL is EXPTIME-complete).
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR95b.html">[DNR95b]</A> an epistemic concept language
is proposed, where the epistemic operator is interpreted in
terms of minimal knowledge.  It is shown that the proposed
formalism provides an adequate characterization of many
non-first-order aspects of frame-based knowledge
representation systems by admitting in the knowledge base
various forms of epistemic sentences.  In particular, it is shown
that the epistemic concept language is able to formalize forms
of reasoning like defaults and role closure, which are actually
provided by several knowledge representation systems.
<P>Structured knowledge representation languages bear
similarities to database models and make possible to enhance
their expressive power.  A concept language, powerful enough
to model frame systems, object-oriented database languages
and semantic data models, is shown in [?].  The high
expressivness of the language (and the need for capturing
reasoning in different contexts) forces to distinguish between
unrestricted and finite model reasoning.  It is shown that
reasoning is decidable in both cases.  This is achieved by a
correspondence with propositional dynamic logic for
unrestricted model reasoning and by linear programming
techniques for finite model reasoning.  The interaction
between different types of constraints has been further
analyzed for semantic data models in [?].  A sound and
complete method is proposed for reasoning effectively about a
set of ISA and cardinality constraints in an extended
Entity-Relationship model to check either the satisfiability of
a schema or whether a schema implies a given constraint.
<P>One distinctive characteristic of object-oriented data
models over traditional database systems is that they provide
more expressive power in schema definition.  Nevertheless, the
defining power of object-oriented models is still somewhat
limited, mainly because it is commonly accepted that part of
the semantics of the application can be represented within
methods.  The research work reported in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-95.html">[CDL95]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-degi-lenz-95-b.html">[CDL94]</A> explores the possibility of
enhancing the power of object-oriented data models in schema
definition, thus offering more possibilities to reason about the
intension of the database and better supporting data
management.  The approach is demonstrated by presenting a
new data model that extends usual object-oriented data
models with several aspects, including view definition,
recursive structure modeling, schema navigation by forward
and backward traversal of links (attributes and relations),
subsetting of attributes and cardinality ratio constraints on
links.  The model is equipped with sound, complete, and
terminating inference procedures allowing for various forms of
reasoning on the intensional level of the database.  A further
extension for statistical aggregates modeling is presented in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-nagg-96.html">[DGN96]</A>.
<P>The complexity of schema level reasoning for less
expressive logics is analyzed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-96-b.html">[Cal96a]</A>.  While
the computational complexity of reasoning on pure concept
expressions has been completely characterized for all relevant
description logics, reasoning in presence of schema axioms is
not so well understood and far from being settled completely.
An important class of schemata is that of primitive schemata
(in which the schema axioms express only necessary
conditions) possibly containing cycles.  This paper provides,
for a relevant class of description logics, a complete
characterization of computational complexity of reasoning
with these types of schemata, both in the presence and in the
absence of cycles.  These results are obtained by devising
reasoning procedures that can deal with disjunction, showing
PSPACE-hardness of concept consistency already for the
simplest language, and introducing a general technique by
which the constructor for existential quantification can be
removed without affecting the result of reasoning.
<P>A detailed treatment of schema level reasoning for a rich
class of schema definition languages, devised in an incremental
manner, is presented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/calv-96.html">[Cal96b]</A>.  Lower bounds
for reasoning with respect to several interesting types of
schemata are shown and sound and complete resoning
procedures are presented.  Reasoning is analyzed separately for
the unrestricted case, i.e. when considering arbitrary, possibly
infinite database states, and for the finite case, i.e. when only
finite databases are taken into account.  In both cases tight
complexity bounds are established.  The high expressiveness of
the studied languages allows to model several representation
formalism used both in Knowledge Representation and
databases.  Therefore, the developed reasoning procedures can
immediately be exploited in different contexts.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/rumo-comp-95.html">[RC95]</A> a new logical approach to
information system requirements modelling and analysis
centred around a formal but user-friendly language called
TRDL is presented.  The language is based on a new kind of
ontological and methodological framework for conceptual
modelling and reasoning in Information Systems Engineering
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/comp-rumo-95.html">[CR95]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/comp-rumo-96.html">[CR96]</A>.  TRDL
is a formal analyst-oriented Terminological Requirements
Description Language allowing an integrated representation of
both structural and behavioural requirements concepts.  Its
semantics is based on a new enhanced terminological language
called ERP, which is an extension of terminological languages
introduced in order to capture process concepts.  The
expressive power of TRDL-based schemes is shown in terms of
the ERP language <A HREF="/~ai/citations/rumo-comp-95.html">[RC95]</A>.  The
correspondence with ERP characterises the overall reasoning
properties of the TRDL model:  completeness, soundness and
EXPTIME complexity.  Such a framework is regarded as a
needed formal background in the development of a new
generation of CASE tools endowed with deductive capabilities
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/comp-rumo-95b.html">[CRa]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/comp-rumo-95c.html">[CRb]</A>.  The
expressive power of TRDL-based schemes is shown comparing
them with requirements descriptions based on different
ontologies of concepts <A HREF="/~ai/citations/comp-rumo-95d.html">[CRc]</A>.
<P>The 1995 International Workshop on Description Logics,
held on June 2 and 3, 1995, at the Centro Congressi of
Universita` di Roma "La Sapienza", was organized by
members of the Artificial Intelligence Research Group, with
the contribution of Dipartimento di Informatica e
Sistemistica.  The papers presented at the workshop are
collected in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DLW95.html">[DLW95]</A>.
<h2>Non-Monotonic and Non-Classical Reasoning</h2>

<P>The complexity of non-monotonic applications has been
studied since the '80s.  It is an important question to decide
whether a non-monotonic way of reasoning is effectively
computable.  Several studies about complexity of
Non-Monotonic Reasoning showed that inference in
non-monotonic knowledge bases is significantly harder than
inference in monotonic ones.  This contrasts with the general
idea that Non-Monotonic Reasoning can be used to make
knowledge representation and reasoning simpler, not harder.
The work <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-doni-scha-95.html">[CDS95]</A> shows that
Non-Monotonic Reasoning has fulfilled a different goal,
namely the efficient representation of knowledge with respect
to space.
<P>In particular it is shown that circumscription allows for a
more compact and natural representation of knowledge.
Circumscription intractability can therefore be interpreted as
the price to pay for having such an extra-compact
representation.  Namely, it can be shown that circumscription
is more succinct than other formalisms, i.e. it allows for a
more compact definition of knowledge.  Papers
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-doni-scha-95.html">[CDS95]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-95-b.html">[CDSS95]</A>
outline a method for proving that the size of a purely
propositional representation of the circumscription CIRC(T )
of a propositional formula T  grows faster than any polynomial
as the size of T  increases.  Significant results can also be
exported in the related field of closed-word reasoning.
<P>Belief Revision is an area of Non-Monotonic Reasoning
involving the problem of changing the knowledge as a result of
a contradictory observation.  A specific computational aspect
of Belief Revision is the size of the propositional formula
obtained by revising a formula with another formula.
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-etal-95.html">[CDLS95]</A> focuses on the size of the smallest
formula equivalent to the revised knowledge base.  Its main
result is that not all formalizations of belief revision are equal
from this point of view.  Some of them allow the revised
knowledge base to be always expressed with a formula
admitting a polynomial-space representation while others do
not:  formalisms with the same complexity may have different
compactability properties.  The Horn case (relevant due to its
computational tractability) is studied in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-95.html">[Lib95]</A>.
<P>The relationship between Belief Revision and
Circumscription is analyzed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-scha-95-a.html">[LS95b]</A>,
where relations between different Belief Revision operators
and forms of Circumscription are established and
characterized, thus largely extending the pioneering work of
Winslett.  A particular operator for belief change, which
satisfies the property of commutativity, is also studied in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/libe-scha-95-b.html">[LS95a]</A>, where a set of postulates is given
and a representation theorem is proved.
<P>Reasoning by default constitutes another important field of
research in non-monotonic logic, since it provides a formalism
for reasoning about rules which are generally true but can be
defeated.  In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-eite-gott-97.html">[CEG97]</A> the possibility of
using Default Logic as a query language for relational
databases is studied.  It is proven that DQL is as expressive as
the existential universal fragment of second order logic and
complexity results are discussed.  Moreover practical cases are
shown where default query languages have more expressive
power than traditional non monotonic relational databases
such as DATALOG with non monotonic negation.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-palo-95.html">[CP95]</A> another relational database
query language has been investigated.  The language has the
same syntax as DATALOG, but its semantics is based on a
more general notion of minimal models, inspired by
circumscription.  Boolean queries of the language are shown to
capture exactly the complexity class coNP, thus resulting in a
language much more expressive than DATALOG. Polynomial
cases and general algorithms are shown and combined
complexity is analyzed.
<P>An automated reasoning approach to Default Logic is
pursued in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96c.html">[ACAGP96a]</A>, where tableaux
for default reasoning are presented.  The proposed calculus
covers in a uniform way a wide number of different proposals
of default formalism such as Reiter's, Brewka's and
Lukaszewicz' ones.  The above mentioned paper completes the
study on the proof theoretical aspects of Default Logic begun
in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-aiel-pirr-95.html">[ACAP95]</A> with a focus on
Hilbert-style proof systems.  The aim of
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-aiel-pirr-95.html">[ACAP95]</A> is to describe default logic as
a logic where the juxtaposition of default (Hilbert-style)
proofs is subordinate to a restriction condition.  This property
is applied to different default systems presented in the
literature and new default logics are also presented.
<P>The relationship between Default and Modal Logic
provability theory is thoroughly analyzed in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96c.html">[ACAGP96a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96b.html">[ACAGP96b]</A>.  These works identify a
family of modal logics (namely those between KD4 and
KD4LZ) which can suitably represent the different non
monotonic features of Default Logic in a monotonic context.
A systematic translation of default theories into modal
formulas is provided so that a suitable self-referential sentence
is associated with the fix point of each default theory.  The
connection between modal provability theory and default logic
is highlighted.  The above work continues the research
tradition in which definitions of extensions in default logic are
related to modal systems.  The main innovation is the attempt
to get the most out of reflection results due to G"odel and
developed by Boolos, Smorynski, Bernardi, and Solovay.
<P>On the basis of the results reported in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96c.html">[ACAGP96a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96b.html">[ACAGP96b]</A>, in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/amat-etal-96.html">[ACAP96]</A> is shown that the modal logic
KD4Z is also suitable to solve the problem of explicit
definability of concepts.  The definition of concepts, in fact, is
a central problem in Commonsense reasoning.  Non monotonic
reasoning provides implicit definitions of concepts relative to a
context - the current theory of the world.
<P>The different possibilities for representing and reasoning
about meta-logical properties, knowledge and belief in a
multi-agent scenario are reviewed in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/aiel-etal-95.html">[CACNS95]</A>.  The paper surveys two family of
languages, those based on modal operators and those based
on first-order logic enriched with meta-level capabilities.
These approaches are thoroughly compared with respect to
the issues of consistency, expressiveness and translation of
modal systems into meta-level first-order formalisms.
<P>The study and development of automated reasoning
approaches toward logics for representing knowledge, belief,
action and contextual reasoning has been carried forward
leading both to computational results and formal calculi.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-95.html">[Mas95a]</A> a tableau calculus combines
modal logics of knowledge and belief with contextual
reasoning.  In this setting it is possible to perform modal
deduction for knowledge and belief and cope with a limited
form of inconsistency:  two consistent modal statements may
globally contradict each other, whereas inconsistent
statements are not allowed.
<P>The modelling of context as partial (and possibly
inconsistent) objects has been carried forward in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-95-b.html">[Mas95b]</A> where a tableaux calculus for
McCarthy's Propositional Logic of Contexts has been given.
The calculus is both intuitive for proof presentations and
effective for automated deduction.  The use of superficial
evaluations provides also the user with a sound and
incremental approximation of classical logic.  This result has
also made possible to determine the computational complexity
of contextual reasoning (NP-completeness) and to draw some
comparisons with competing formalisms <A HREF="/~ai/citations/mass-96.html">[Mas96]</A>.
<P>The use of prefixed tableaux also led to the developement
of new calculi for automated deduction for reasoning about
actions in a complex framework with iteration, choice and
converse operators <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-mass-96.html">[DGM96]</A>.
<P>The study of ground nonmonotonic modal logics has been
carried out in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR95.html">[DNR95a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/NaRo95.html">[NR95]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR95c.html">[DNR95]</A>.  <A HREF="/~ai/citations/NaRo95.html">[NR95]</A> presents a
possible-world semantics for ground logics, a variant of the
nonmonotonic modal logics due to McDermott and Doyle.
The basic intuition is to minimize the knowledge expressed by
non-modal formulae, which is accomplished through a
preference relation on Kripke models that both generalizes the
notion of minimal knowledge and provides a semantic
characterization for this class of modal formalisms.
<P>The computational properties of ground logics are further
analyzed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR95.html">[DNR95a]</A>.  A major result is that
reasoning in the ground logic for the modal system S5 can be
placed at the third level of the polynomial hierarchy.  It is also
proved that this is a lower bound for reasoning in all ground
logics and an upper bound for most such formalisms.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/DoNR95c.html">[DNR95]</A> the epistemological properties
of ground logics are analyzed by addressing their usage in
knowledge representation.  Several representational features of
ground logics are discussed, in particular defaults and forward
rules, and a thorough comparison with McDermott and
Doyle's logics is provided.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-95a.html">[Err95]</A> optimization problems concerning
different notions of models are defined.  In particular, the
problem of minimizing the number of literals belonging to a
model or maximizing the number of literals that do not
belong to a model of a CNF formula is analyzed in the setting
of two, three and four-valued propositional logic.  These
problems, which can be seen as the optimization versions of
well-known model-finding problems in nonmonotonic
reasoning and abductive reasoning, are characterized in terms
of complexity approximation classes.  On the one hand,
negative results concerning non-approximability in polynomial
time for the general problems are shown, while, on the other
hand, syntactical restrictions that allow for approximate
solutions are found.
<P>One of the major problems in the use of Non-Monotonic
Reasoning and Non-Classical Logics is their high
computational complexity, which is usually far beyond NP. As
efficiency of AI systems is crucial for their success, feasible
aspects of the logical approach to Artificial Intelligence has
been thoroughly investigated.  The first strategy is language
restriction:  the language used for representing knowledge is
restricted so that the formalization of interesting cases is still
possible, but inference tasks are computationally feasible.  The
second strategy is theory approximation:  a form of logic is
approximated by using another one that allows weaker (yet
computationally feasible) inferential power.  A general
overview of problems and solutions based on these approaches
can be found in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-95.html">[Cad95]</A>.  The book analyzes the
tractability threshold of several problems, finding
polynomially tractable cases _ for which polynomial-time
algorithms are given _ and intractable cases.  Propositional
as well as first-order formulae, decision as well as constructive
problems are taken into account, thus modeling several
reasoning patterns.
<P>The problem of tractable reasoning via approximation is
also extensively studied in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/scha-cado-95.html">[SC95]</A>, where
semantically well-founded logics for approximate reasoning
and fast algorithms (even for fully expressive languages) are
provided.  The method provides both sound approximations
and complete ones and is flexible enough to be applied to a
wide range of reasoning problems:  Propositional Logic,
fragments of First Order Logic (Concept Description
Languages) and Modal Logic.  In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-scha-95.html">[CS95]</A> it
has been extended to cope with Default Reasoning and
Circumscription with a clear semantics based on multi-valued
logic.
<P>A recent approach to tractable reasoning consists in
knowledge base preprocessing, in order to obtain a data
structure that allows fast on-line query answering algorithms.
The state-of-the-art of this technique _known as knowledge
compilation_ has been discussed in a panel
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cado-96.html">[Cad96]</A> held at an international symposium.
<h2>Abduction</h2>

<P>Abduction is a topic that attracts much interest in AI and
automated reasoning research.  Different approaches have been
devised providing a formalized account of explanatory
reasoning, methods to compute explanations and a framing
for abduction in the context of logic programming.
<P>However, the logical nature of abduction is still far from
being clear and different specifications of the key underlying
concepts have been given, so that it is difficult to speak of
abduction as a single well-defined form of reasoning.  In
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/pirr-95.html">[Pir95]</A> the logical structure of abduction and the
real nature of the notion of explanation is studied.  Both a
formalization of abduction based on deductive systems and a
formalization of abduction as a logical system is given.  The
work is divided into two parts.  In the first part abduction is
presented as a meta-calculus, stemming from the consequence
relation of the logic it is defined upon.  This presentation of
abduction follows the classical view that correlates abduction
to deduction.  In the second part abduction is proposed as a
logical system by itself, independent from deductive systems,
although interlaced with classical entailment.  A semantics for
abduction is provided defining an abductive relation in terms
of proof-theoretic properties.
<P>Calculi for propositional, first order and modal logics are
presented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cial-pirr-95.html">[CP95]</A> and shown to be sound
and complete.  The calculi are based on semantic tableaux and
a dual version based on sequent calculi is also given for
propositional and first order logics.  In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/cial-pirr-96.html">[CP96]</A>
a preliminary discussion on the logical nature of abductive
reasoning, emphasizing the fundamental difference between
abductive and deductive inference, is addressed.  Some logical
properties of the inference to the "best explanation" are put
forward and analyzed when the underlying logic is any
extension of classical propositional logic (first order logic,
propositional modal logic) or a non monotonic system.  In [?]
a logic for abduction is presented, namely a language, a
semantics and a proof theory where the abductive relation can
be expressed.  The abductive relation is the relation between a
preferred sentence explaining a given observation, in the
context of a background theory, and such an observation itself.
The proposed logical system, based on a modal approach,
captures propositional abduction over a finite language.
<h2>Intelligent Systems</h2>

<P>Artificial Intelligence techniques have been applied to
problems from different domains.  Experimental systems have
been realized for tasks such as intelligent tutoring, user
modeling, agent coordination, timetable generation and
information extraction from texts.
<P>Relevant possibilities of industrial applications come from
the study of a general framework for the automatic generation
of Intelligent Tutoring Systems from given applications.
Indeed, building an explanation facility to support an
application is a time consuming task.  In particular, in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/LNS95.html">[LNS95]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/LNS95b.html">[LNS95]</A> the research has
focussed on the realization of a tool for the automatic
generation of explanations in conventional spreadsheet
applications.  The system works in two stages.  At first it
constructs a knowledge base for the mathematical relations
coded into a programmed spreadsheet.  Then it uses its
knowledge base to generate automatically two kinds of
support that can make the application self-instructive:  a
hyper-textual guide and an interactive tutor.
<P>In <A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-96.html">[EA96]</A>, further extending previous work
carried on in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-95.html">[EPP95]</A>, a new agent based
language is proposed, aimed at representing the epistemic
states of interactive systems users, with the goal to devise
domain independent tools for building, updating and
maintaining user models.  The need of coping with change and
update motivates the choice to define this language within the
Situation Calculus, thus a multi agent Situation Calculus with
clusters of alternative situations is here introduced.
<P>Communication between agents and the planning of load
balancing in a multi agent environment have been tackled in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/ScST95.html">[SST95]</A> with a particular focus on learning.  The
problem is addressed for systems which can relay neither on
central coordination nor on explicit communication.  Results
have been found on the interplay between basic adaptive
behavior parameters and system efficiency.  The properties of
adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations are also
investigated.
<P>A different investigation tackled the high-school
timetabling problem using local search (or iterative
improvement) techniques.  Various techniques are
experimented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/ScSc95.html">[SS95]</A> and a new algorithm
based on tabu search, that interleaves different types of moves
and makes use of an adaptive relaxation of the hard
constraints, is developed in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/Scha96.html">[Sch96]</A>.  The
implementation of the algorithm has been successfully
experimented in some large high schools.
<P>The advantages of a combined use of statistical and
linguistic techniques in a system for information extraction
from short news stories are highlighted in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/cira-can-95.html">[CC95]</A>.  In system ECO texts are
preprocessed using combined statistical and knowledge based
techniques with the aim of determining the general subject
(classification) and of giving suggestions for the following
parsing step.  Parsing control strategies based on such
suggestions are adopted, thus significantly reducing the
computational effort

<h2>Logic Programming and Deductive Databases</h2>

<P>Logic programming studies focus on the generation of
prime implicants, on the introduction in logic programming
languages of constructs borrowed from the logical theory of
sets and on the semantics of non-Horn deductive databases.
<P>A novel approach to prime implicants generation based on
integer programming is presented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/erri-95.html">[EPP95]</A>.  The
problem of finding prime implicants is transformed into an
equivalent one consisting in the solution of a set of linear
equations with constraints.  This task is accomplished by
searching for the solution set of an equivalent problem of
Integer Programming.  This work presents a generative
algorithm which computes all prime implicants one at a time.
Such an approach has significant advantages over other
methods.
<P>Formerly initiated research on logic programming
enhanced with sets has been carried on.  The primary goal of
this research is to build into logic programming languages
some interpreted constructs borrowed from the logical theory
of sets.  General objectives are:  rapid prototyping on the
practical side and, on the theoretical side, deeper insights
(drawn from a specific yet very fundamental scenario) on the
power of constraint logic programming and about the
usefulness of negation and set-grouping for the handling of
abstraction terms.  Suitable axiomatizations of sets
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/omod-poli-95.html">[OP95]</A> offer a unified framework where
basic set operations (like insertion or deletion of an element
into/from a set) enter in combination with free Herbrand
constructions.
<P>While major semantical difficulties have already been
settled down at the theoretical level regarding finite sets,
algorithmic complexity issues <A HREF="/~ai/citations/omod-parl-poli-95.html">[OPP95]</A>,
as well as generalizations to the theories of multi-sets,
non-well-founded sets <A HREF="/~ai/citations/omod-poli-95.html">[OP95]</A> and infinite
sets, are just now beginning to be investigated.  A parallel
research on automatic synthesis of concrete data structures
for sets and of set operations is in its initial phase.
<P>While the semantics of Horn deductive databases is well
understood, many different proposal have been presented in
literature to characterize the semantics of non-Horn deductive
databases.  Paper <A HREF="/~ai/citations/scha-95.html">[Sch95]</A> presents a comparison
and an attempt to reconcile the two major approaches to the
treatment of negation in deductive databases:  the logic
programming view of clauses as inference rules and the
closed-world approach aiming at minimizing the positive
knowledge.

<h2>Planning and Reasoning about Actions</h2>

<P>The research activity has followed several directions.  A
first aspect concerns the study of architectures for
knowledge-based activity management and the design of
flexible modules that tackle specific aspects of the problem.  A
specialized module that deals with time information has been
further improved.  In particular new results are described in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/CeO95c.html">[CO96]</A> where the formal properties of a fully
dynamic management of quantitative temporal constraints are
described.  Very recently the problem of representing
integrated time and resource constraints has also been
considered.  A specialized language for representing planning
domain knowledge, named DDL.1, have been formalized and
its connections with a temporal planner described in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/CeO95b.html">[CO95b]</A> and <A HREF="/~ai/citations/CeO95a.html">[CO95a]</A>.  DDL.1
representation adopts basic ideas from control theory
extended to allow the specification of constraints.  The
planning problem is seen as the problem of deciding the
behavior of a dynamic domain.  Different aspects of an
implemented system, named DRS-Sched, for planning the
activities of a particular satellite system (the DRS) are
instead described in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/ADI95.html">[AC95]</A>.
<P>As for reasoning about actions, specific propositional
dynamic logics for reasoning in the style of the "situation
calculus" have been investigated in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lenz-95-SPRAAAI.html">[DGL95a]</A><A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-lenz-95-AIIA.html">[DGL95c]</A>.  These logics inherit the
clean and well characterized semantics of propositional
dynamic logics and are suitably equipped in order to allow
reference to past situations and to denote sets of primitive
actions executed together, either taking or not taking part in
a concurrent action.  Moreover, interdependencies between
primitive actions, such as specialization or disjointness, can be
expressed.  Notably these capabilities allow for exploiting
Reiter's solution of the frame problem in the setting of
propositional dynamic logics.  Decidability and computational
complexity for these logics are established.
<P>An approach to planning within the framework of
description logics is presented in <A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-etal-96.html">[DGINR96]</A>.
The approach is based on the formalization of actions given
by dynamic logics, taking advantage of both the
representational mechanisms provided by description logics
and the introspective capabilities obtained by extending the
language with an epistemic operator.  From a practical
viewpoint the reasoning capabilities of description logics,
realized in the system Classic, are used in order to
implement an actual agent, the mobile robot TINO.
<P>An alternative way of reasoning about actions is studied in
<A HREF="/~ai/citations/degi-chen-96-AAAI.html">[DGC96]</A>, where a model checking
approach in contrast to the usual validity checking one is
followed.  A dynamic system is modeled, by means of a
suitable description formalism (a process algebra), as a
transition graph representing all the possible system
evolutions in terms of state changes caused by actions.  A
suitable extension of modal mu-calculus is adopted as
reasoning formalism.  A property of the dynamic system is
verified by checking the truth-value of a formula in the
corresponding transition graph (model checking).  This setting
inherits from the vast literature on process algebras tools for
dealing with complex systems, treating suitably important
aspects like parallelism, communications, interruptions and
coordinations among agents.  Moreover reasoning by model
checking (which presuppose complete information on system
behavior) is typically much easier than more general logical
services such as validity checking.
