In this paper we discuss ground logics, a family of nonmonotonic modal logics,
with the goal of using them in knowledge representation. Ground logics are
based on the idea of minimizing the knowledge expressed by non-modal
formulae. The nonmonotonic character of the logics can be described either by
a fix-point equation that introduces assumptions on the non-modal part of the



theory, or by means of a preference relation on possible-worlds models. We
address both the epistemological and the computational properties of ground
logics. We discuss the representational features by providing a thorough
comparison between them and McDermott and Doyle logics. We find that
there are a number of interesting notions that are nicely captured by ground
logics. Particularly interesting is the ground logic for S5. We show that
reasoning in ground logics is  p3-hard. Moreover we prove that  p3is also an
upper bound for reasoning in the major ground logics. Moreover, we identify
some special cases of practical interest where the complexity of reasoning in
ground logics is lower than in the general case.
