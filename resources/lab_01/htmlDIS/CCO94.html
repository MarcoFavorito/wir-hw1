                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>This  paper  concerns  the  specialization  of  arc-consistency  algorithms  for  constraint satisfaction in the management of quantitative temporal
                   constraint networks. Attention is devoted to the design of algorithms  that  support  an  incremental  style  of  building  solutions
                   allowing  both  constraint  posting  and  constraint  retraction.  In
                   particular, the AC-3 algorithm for constraint propagation, customized to temporal networks without disjunctions, is presented,


                   and  the  concept  of  dependency  between  constraints  described.<p>
                   The dependency information is useful to dynamically maintain a
                   trace of the more relevant constraints in a network. The concept
                   of dependency is used to integrate the basic AC-3 algorithm with
                   a sufficient condition for inconsistency detection that speeds up
                   its performance, and to design an effective incremental operator
                   for constraint retraction.<p>
