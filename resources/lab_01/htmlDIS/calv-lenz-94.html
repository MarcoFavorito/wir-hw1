ISA and cardinality constraints are among the most interesting types of
constraints in data models. ISA constraints are used to establish several forms
of containment among classes, and are receiving great attention in moving to
object-oriented data models, where classes are organized in hierarchies based
on a generalization/specialization principle. Cardinality constraints impose
restrictions on the number of links of a certain type involving every instance of
a given class, and can be used for representing several forms of dependencies
beteewn classes, including functional and existence dependencies. While the
formal properties of each type of constraints are now well understood, little is
known of their interaction. The goal of this paper is to present an effective
method for reasoning about a set of ISA and cardinality constraints in the
context of a simple data model based on the notions of classes and
relationships. In particular, the method allows one both to verify the
satisfiability of a schema and to check whether a schema implies a given
constraint of any of the two kinds. We prove that the method is sound and
complete, thus showing that the reasoning problem for ISA and cardinality
constraints is decidable.
