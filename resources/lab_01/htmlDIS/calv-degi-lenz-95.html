One distinctive characteristic of object-oriented data models over traditional
database systems is that they provide more expressive power in schema
definition. Nevertheless, the defining power of object-oriented models is still
somewhat limited, mainly because it is commonly accepted that part of the
semantics of the application can be represented within methods. The research
work reported in this paper explores the possibility of enhancing the power of
object-oriented data models in schema definition, thus offering more
possibilities to reason about the intension of the database and better
supporting data management. We demonstrate our approach by presenting a
new data model, called CVL, that extends the usual object-oriented data
models with several aspects, including view definition, recursive structure
modeling, navigation of the schema through forward and backward traversal of
links (attributes and relations), subsetting of attributes, and cardinality ratio
constraints on links. CVL is equipped with sound, complete, and terminating
inference procedures, that allow various forms of reasoning to be carried out
on the intensional level of the database.
