This book presents a collection of coordinated scientific 
papers describing the research activities  and the scientific 
and technical results achieved within the Tasso research 
initiative. Tasso has been promoted and funded by the Italian 
National Research Council (Consiglio Nazionale delle  
Ricerche - CNR), within the national research project on 
{\em Sistemi Informatici e Calcolo  Parallelo}. Part of the 
project has 
been conducted in cooperation with the Research Institute 
for  Symbolic Computation (RISC) of the University 
Johannes Kepler, Linz, Austria. 
New methodological aspects related to design and 
implementation of symbolic computation  systems are 
considered in Tasso. The aim of this research project is to 
integrate such aspects  into a homogeneous software 
environment for scientific computation. The proposed  
methodology is based on a combination of different 
techniques: algebraic specification through  modular 
approach and completion algorithms, approximated and 
exact algebraic computing  methods, object-oriented 
programming paradigm, automated theorem proving 
through methods a la Hilbert and methods of natural 
deduction. 
<p>
In order to experiment with the proposed 
methodology and to show its effectiveness, the  design of a 
prototypal implementation of a computing environment 
represents a specific goal of  the project. In this 
environment, several modules for specification of 
mathematical structures  and treatment of their logic 
properties are integrated and managed by a suitable 
interface.
<p>
The papers in this volume are organized in four parts, each 
one collecting and sequencing  related subjects. 

These papers describes mostly the theoretical activity developed 
in the project; the practical achievements are also presented in some papers:
the Tasso programming language, implementations of deductive mechanisms and 
algebraic computing tools.

Some papers not directly connected to the practical achievements have been
included, to provide a better comprehension of general arguments related 
to the topics of the project.
<p>
The  introductory Part I describes
the state of the art in  symbolic mathematical  computation and the
requirements  for advanced software systems; it motivates and founds the  
general approach followed by Tasso for the integration of  specification and
computing  paradigms. 
<p>
The proposed  treatment of mathematical objects, via
techniques for  method  abstraction, structures classification and exact 
representation is presented in Part II.
<p>
The  programming  methodology that
supports the design and implementation  issues is described in  Part III.
<p>
The reasoning capabilities  supported by the environment are presented 
in Part IV.

The work for Tasso Project, and the interest in related 
subjects arisen within the international  scientific 
community, gave great impulse to the organization of the 
DISCO conferences on {\em Design and Implementation of 
Symbolic Computation Systems}, held in Capri (Italy, 1990), 
Bath (United Kingdom, 1992) and Gmunden (Austria, 
1993).
