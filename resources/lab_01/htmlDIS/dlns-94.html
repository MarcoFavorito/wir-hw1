It is a common opinion that subsumption is the central reasoning task in
frame-based knowledge representation languages (or concept languages).
Intuitively, a concept C subsumes another concept D if the set of objects
represented by C is a superset of the one represented by D. When individual
objects are taken into account, the basic deductive task for retrieving
information from a knowledge base is instance checking, that amounts to
checking whether the knowledge base implies that an individual is an instance
of a given concept. In this paper, we address the question of whether instance
checking can be solved by means of subsumption algorithms. We do so by
considering several languages where subsumption belongs to different
complexity classes. For such languages we present methods for the instance
checking problem, provide a complexity analysis of this problem, and compare
it with the subsumption problem. The main result of the paper is that
instance checking is not always easily reducible to subsumption. In particular,
there are cases where it is strictly harder than subsumption. This impacts on
the design of reasoning algorithms for knowledge representation systems based
on concept languages.
