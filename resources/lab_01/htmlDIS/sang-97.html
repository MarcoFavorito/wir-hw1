Behaviour protocols are often used to coordinate the action of a group of two
or more agents by limiting the nature of the agents' goals and the possibility
of backtracking in the negotiation. The solution presented in this paper
achieves the maximum flexibility because the negotiation itself is object of the
planning activity. We extend the reasoning mechanism with the introduction
of the concept of "knowledge contextualization": each context is a set of
constraints to the agent action used to describe both plans and agreement
offers. A working example is presented to illustrate these ideas. It shows the
simulation of a player of "Diplomacy", a complete (and difficult) game of
strategy and diplomacy. Finally, we propose a backtracking mechanism to
solve the contradictions between the constraints of different contexts. This
mechanism is compared with the Dependency Directed Backtracking (DDB) of
the TMSs and it is shown that, in our case, it is complete while, DDB is not.
