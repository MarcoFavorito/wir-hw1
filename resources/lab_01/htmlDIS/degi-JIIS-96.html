Intensional query answering aims at providing a response to a query addressed
to a knowledge base by making use of the intensional knowledge as opposed to
extensional. Such a response is an abstract description of the conventional
answer that can be of interest in many situations, for example it may increase
the cooperativeness of the system, or it may replace the conventional answer
in case access to the extensional part of the knowledge base is costly as for
Mobile Systems. In this paper we present a general framework to generate
intensional answers in knowledge bases adhering to the logic programming
paradigm. Such a framework is based on a program transformation technique,
namely Partial Evaluation, and allows for generating complete and
procedurally complete (wrt SLDNF-resolution) sets of intensional answers,
treating both recursion and negation conveniently.
