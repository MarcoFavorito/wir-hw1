                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>One of the main
                   themes in the area of Terminological Reasoning has been to identify description logics (DLs) that are both very expressive and
                   decidable. A recent paper by Schild showed that this issue can
                   be profitably addressed by relying on a correspondence between
                   DLs  and  propositional  dynamic  logics  (PDL).  However  Schild
                   left  open  three  important  problems,  related  to  the  translation
                   into  PDLs  of  functional  restrictions  on  roles  (both  direct  and
                   inverse), number restrictions, and assertions on individuals. The
                   work reported in this paper presents a solution to these problems.<p>
                   The results have a twofold significance. From the standpoint of
                   DLs,  we derive decidability and complexity results for some of
                   the most expressive logics appeared in the literature, and from
                   the standpoint of PDLs, we derive a general methodology for the
                   representation of several forms of program determinism and for
                   the specification of partial computations.<p>
