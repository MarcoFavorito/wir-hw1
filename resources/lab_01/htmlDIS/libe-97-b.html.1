In this paper we anliyze the complexity of the language A, proposed by
Gelfond and Lifschitz (1993) to formalize properties of actions. We prove that
the general language is NP complete, thus intractable, and show some
tractable (polynomial) subclasses of it. We also show how states that are
unreachable affect the semantics of the language.
