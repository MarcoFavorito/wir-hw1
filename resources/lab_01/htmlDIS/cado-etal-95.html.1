In this paper we address a specific computational aspect of belief revision: The
size  of the propositional formula obtained by means of the revision of a
formula with a new one. In particular, we focus on the size of the smallest
formula equivalent  to the revised knowledge base. The main result of this
paper is that not all formalizations of belief revision are equal from this point
of view. For some of them we show that the revised knowledge base can be
expressed with a formula admitting a polynomial-space representation (we call
these results "compactability" results). On the other hand we are able to



prove that for other ones the revised knowledge base does not always admit a
polynomial-space representation, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses at
a sufficiently low level ("non-compactability" results). The time complexity of
query answering for the revised knowledge base has definitely an impact on
being able to represent the result of the revision compactly. Nevertheless
formalisms with the same complexity may have different compactability
properties.
