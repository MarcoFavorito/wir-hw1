In this paper we present a logic for abduction, namely a language, a semantics
and a proof theory where the abductive relation can be expressed. The
abductive relation is the relation between a preferred sentence explainig a
given observation, in the context of a background theory, and such an
observation itself. The proposed logical system, based on a modal approach,
captures propositional abduction over a finite language.
