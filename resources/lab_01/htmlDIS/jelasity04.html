For example, properties of     the communication topology (that defines who can send messages to whom) play     a crucial role in determining the performance of function like search, routing     or key lookup. Scalability and reliability are also determined by topology.     The ``who knows whom'' relation has other uses as well. It can express sorting,     where nodes know the other nodes that precede or follow them in some ordering     defined over the nodes. Topology can also express clustering, network proximity,     or solutions to search problems where requets are connected to the sources     of information. Motivated by this generality and importance of topology management,     in the present talk we describe scalable, reliable and extremely simple gossip     protocols to create several overlay topologies, inluding random (unstructured)     and structured ones (ring, torus, binary tree). Our protocol scheme, called     T-Man, can construct a large class of topologies that are defined by a single     ranking function that orders nodes according to preference from any fixed     base node. As will be demonstrated, with the appropriate selection of ranking     function T-Man can sort a set of numbers or arrange them in different clustered     or connected topologies.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></P></DL>
