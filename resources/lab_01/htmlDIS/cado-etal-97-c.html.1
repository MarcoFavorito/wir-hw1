Circumscription is a popular common-sense reasoning technique, used in the
fields of Artificial Intelligence, Databases and Logic Programming. In this
paper we investigate the size of representations (formulae, data structures)
equivalent to the circumscription of a propositional formula T , taking into
account three different definitions of equivalence. We find necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of polynomial-size representations
(formulae, data structures) equivalent to the circumscription of T in the three
cases. All such conditions imply the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. In
particular, we prove that - unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses at the
second level - the size of the shortest propositional formula T 0logically
equivalent to the circumscription of T grows faster than any polynomial as the
size of T increases. The significance of this results in the related field of
closed-world reasoning is then analyzed.
