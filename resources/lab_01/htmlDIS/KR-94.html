The notion of class is ubiquitous in Computer Science and is central in many
knowledge representation languages.  In this paper we propose a representation
formalism in the style of concept languages, with the aim of providing a
unified framework for class-based formalisms.  The language we consider is
quite expressive and features a novel combination of constructs including
number restrictions, inverse roles and inclusion assertions with no restrictions
on cycles.  We are able to show that such language is powerful enough to
model frame systems, object-oriented database languages and semantic data
models.  As a consequence of the established correspondences, several
significant extensions of each of the above formalisms become available.  The
high expressivity of the language and the need for capturing the reasoning in
different contexts forces us to distinguish between unrestricted and finite
model reasoning.  A notable feature of our proposal is that reasoning in both
cases is decidable.  For the unrestricted case we exploit a correspondence with
propositional dynamic logic and extend it to the treatment of number
restrictions.  For the finite model case we develop a new method based on the
use of linear programming techniques.  We argue that, by virtue of the high
expressive power and of the associated reasoning techniques on both
unrestricted and finite models, our language provides a unified framework for
class-based representation formalisms.
