<P>Nowadays, data can be represented and stored by using different formats 
ranging from non structured data, typical of file systems, to semistructured 
data, typical of Web sources, to highly structured data, typical of relational 
database systems. Therefore, the necessity arises to define new models and 
approaches for uniformly handling datasources having different formats and 
structures, and obtaining a global, integrated, and uniform representation. In 
this paper we present three approaches to data integration and propose a 
unifying framework integrating the various methodologies and incorporating 
techniques developed separately. We also present the architecture of a metadata 
repository supporting the integration framework.</P>
