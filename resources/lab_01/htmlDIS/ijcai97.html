<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>We present Autoepistemic Description Logics (ADLs), in which the language
of Description Logics is augmented with modal operators interpreted according
to the nonmonotonic logic MKNF. We provide decision procedures for query
answering in two very expressive ADLs. We show their representational features
by addressing defaults, integrity constraints, role and concept closure.
Hence, ADLs provide a formal characterization of a wide variety of nonmonotonic
features commonly available in frame-based systems and needed in the development
of practical applications.</P>
