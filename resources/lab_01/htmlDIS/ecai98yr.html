<H1>Expressiveness vs. complexity in nonmonotonic knowledge bases:
propositional case</H1>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>We study the trade-off between the expressive abilities and the complexity
of reasoning in propositional nonmonotonic knowledge bases. We first
analyze, in an expressive epistemic modal framework, the most popular forms of
nonmonotonic mechanisms used in knowledge representation: in particular, we
prove that epistemic queries and epistemic integrity constraints are
naturally expressed through the notion of negation as failure. Based on the
above analysis, we then characterize the complexity of reasoning with
different subsets of such nonmonotonic constructs. This characterization
induces a complexity based classification of the various forms of
nonmonotonic reasoning considered: in particular, we prove that negation as
failure is computationally harder than epistemic disjunction, which
apparently contradicts previous complexity results obtained in the
logic programming setting. </P>
