<H1>Information integration: Conceptual modeling and reasoning support</H1>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>Information Integration is one of the core problems in cooperative
information systems.  We argue that two critical factors for the design and
maintenance of applications requiring Information Integration are conceptual
modeling of the domain, and reasoning support over the conceptual
representation.  In particular, we present a general architecture for
Information Integration that explicitly includes a conceptual
representation
of the application. We illustrate how the architecture can express several
integration settings and existing systems.  We provide various arguments in
favor of the conceptual level in the architecture and of automated reasoning
over the conceptual representation.  Finally, we present a specific proposal
of an integration system which realizes the general architecture and is
equipped with decidable reasoning procedures.
