                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this paper we
                   address  a  specific  computational  aspect  of  belief  revision:  The
                   size  of the propositional formula obtained by means of the revision of a formula with a new one. In particular, we focus on the
                   size of the smallest formula equivalent  to the revised knowledge
                   base. The main result of this paper is that not all formalizations
                   of belief revision are equal from this point of view. For some of
                   them we show that the revised knowledge base can be expressed
                   with a formula admitting a polynomial-space representation (we
                   call these results "compactability" results). On the other hand we
                   are able to prove that for other ones the revised knowledge base
                   does  not  always  admit  a  polynomial-space  representation,  unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses at a sufficiently low level
                   ("non-compactability" results). The time complexity of query answering for the revised knowledge base has definitely an impact
                   on being able to represent the result of the revision compactly.<p>
                   Nevertheless formalisms with the same complexity may have different compactability properties.<p>
