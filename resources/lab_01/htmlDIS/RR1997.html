The central aim of Algorithms Engineering is the study of the techniques
for the design of efficient algorithms and for the formal and experimental
analysis of their performance. Computer systems are becoming more and more
demanding in terms of performance, due to the increasing complexity of
both applications (that, for example, require the repeated solution of
large optimization problems on large sets of data), and computer systems
(that, for example, require a very efficient management of processors,
memories and interconnection networks). In the past twenty years, the theory
of algorithms has laid down the principles of algorithms design and of
complexity analysis of problems. Now, in order to approach the practical
solution of efficiency critical applications, many more aspects have to
be addressed, ranging from the study of realistic computation models, to
the definition of various types of algorithms that have to perform efficiently
in a dynamically changing environment, to the definition of new complexity
measures that allow to assess the practical usability of algorithms.

<P>Research work done in the area of Algorithms Engineering is report in
five subsections, the first three related to two large and very important
problem domains (Graph and combinatorial algorithms, Geometric computing
and Distributed and network algorithms) the last two devoted to two important
methods of processing information and solving problems in very complex
environments.

<B>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="Graph"></A>Graph and combinatorial algorithms</B></H3>
In this area the research has been focusing on dynamic graph algorithms,
dynamic hypergraph algorithms, and algorithmic techniques for several combinatorial
problems.

<P>In <A HREF="#[I2-C-13]">[I2-C-13]</A> the authors maintain the information
on connectivity in a planar graph during arbitrary sequences of insertions
and deletions of edges, and switch-on and switch-off operations on the
vertices. They solve the problem in O(log<SUP>3</SUP> n) time per operation,
improving sharply on previous approaches.

<P>In <A HREF="#[I2-C-12]">[I2-C-12]</A> the authors perform an extensive
experimental study of fully dynamic algorithms for the single source shortest
path problem in digraphs with positive real edge weights. They report experiments
both on random graphs and on real world graphs subject to random sequences
of updates.

<P>In <A HREF="#[I2-C-11]">[I2-C-11]</A> the authors propose the first
semi-dynamic solutions for the single source shortest path problem on digraphs
with integer edge weights, and for the breadth first search problem, which
are more efficient than recomputing the solution from scratch after each
update, taking O(n) amortized time per operation, where n is the number
of nodes. Along the same line of research, in <A HREF="#[I2-J-3]">[I2-J-3]</A>
an incremental algorithm is proposed to maintain a DFS-forest in a directed
acyclic graph under a sequence of arc insertions in O(n) amortized time
per operation. This compares favorably with the time required to recompute
a DFS-forest from scratch. This algorithm relies on an original characterization
of a DFS-forest in terms of a relaxed planar embedding of the graph. These
techniques have been extended to the decremental maintenance of minimum
rank hyperpaths on directed hypergraphs in <A HREF="#[I2-C-4]">[I2-C-4].</A>

<P>In <A HREF="#[I2-C-9]">[I2-C-9]</A> a semi-dynamic setting for the Temporal
Constraint Satisfaction Problem is considered, where one is requested to
maintain the path-consistency of a network under a sequence of insertions
of new (further) constraints between pairs of variables. An algorithm is
presented, running in O(n R<SUP>3</SUP>) amortized time on a sequence of
Q (n<SUP>2</SUP>) insertions, where n is the number of vertices of the
network and R is its range (defined as the maximum size of the minimum
interval containing all the intervals of a single constraint). The algorithm
is general and extendible.

<P>Dynamic algorithms for the on-line maintenance of weighted hypergraphs
have been devised with application to satisfiability of propositional Horn
formulae with uncertainty in <A HREF="#[I2-J-1]">[I2-J-1]</A>, where the
authors show how to represent a significant class of formulae by weighted
directed hypergraphs and present two algorithms that solve the on-line
Horn-SAT problem and find a minimum model for the formula working on the
dynamic weighted hypergraph representation. These algorithms make increasing
assumptions on the formula and the second one solves the on-line Horn-SAT
problem with a total time linear in the size of the formula, matching the
optimal result for Boolean Horn formulae.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<B>2.&nbsp;<A NAME="Geometric"></A>Geometric computing</B></H3>
The research on Geometric computing followed four main directions.

<P>One main task was the design of robust algorithms for computational
geometry, i.e. algorithms that are not affected by numerical errors and
that can handle degenerate configurations of the input. In <A HREF="#[I2-R-8]">[I2-R-8]</A>
and in <A HREF="#[I2-C-16]">[I2-C-16]</A> research has focused on developing
a methodology for designing robust algorithms with low precision arithmetics
demand. In <A HREF="#[I2-C-10]">[I2-C-10]</A> the problem of checking the
output correctness of several geometric algorithms, including those that
compute convex polytopes and those that compute planar subdivisions, is
investigated. A new architectural frame for visualization of geometric
algorithms over the world wide web is described in <A HREF="#[I2-R-5]">[I2-R-5]</A>.

<P>A second direction of research is about characterizing and computing
proximity drawings of graphs. Such family of drawings include minimum weight
triangulations, visibility representations, Gabriel drawings, and rectangle
of influence drawings as special cases. The results obtained combine geometric
graph theory and efficient algorithm design. The geometric constraints
that are taken into account by the algorithms include the clusterization
of groups of adjacent vertices in the drawing, and area minimization. The
area required by visibility representations and by Gabriel drawings is
studied in <A HREF="#[I2-J-4]">[I2-J-4]</A> and in <A HREF="#[I2-C-17]">[I2-C-17]</A>.
Several classes of graphs that admit a rectangle of influence drawing are
characterized in <A HREF="#[I2-J-5]">[I2-J-5]</A>. The relationship between
topology and geometry for well known structures such as minimum weight
triangulations and Delaunay triangulations is investigated in <A HREF="#[I2-C-14]">[I2-C-14]</A>.
The problem of computing orthogonal representations with the minimum number
of bends is studied in <A HREF="#[I2-R-6]">[I2-R-6]</A>.

<P>A third direction of research focused on the study of basic computational
geometry problems. In <A HREF="#[I2-C-8]">[I2-C-8]</A> the authors consider
the problem of maintaining and reporting the maxima of a set of points
in the plane in the partially dynamic setting of boundary updates, defined
by a movable and resizable vertical window on the point set. The authors
present a data structure capable of answering maxima queries in optimal
O(k) worst case time, where k is the size of the answer, and an algorithm
for maintaining the data structure under boundary updates in O(log n) time
per update.

<P>Finally a fourth direction of research applies computational geometry
techniques to data base applications. In <A HREF="#[I2-R-1]">[I2-R-1]</A>
data structures are presented for the efficient implementation of half-space
queries in 2 and 3 dimensions, suitable to secondary memory applications.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<B>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="Distributed"></A>Distributed and network algorithms</B></H3>
In this area, applicative problems have been considered. The problem of
deciding the feasibility of a scheduling for broadcast transmission under
the TDMA protocol is studied in <A HREF="#[I2-J-2]">[I2-J-2]</A>. The problem
is proved to be NP-hard. Polynomial time distributed algorithms are proved
to obtain solutions close to the optimum on practical instances of the
problem.

<P>In <A HREF="#[I2-C-7]">[I2-C-7]</A> the authors consider the problem
of constructing embeddings of 2-dimensional FEM graphs into grids with
the goal of minimizing the edge-congestion and dilation and optimize the
load. The authors introduce some heuristics, analyze their performance,
and present experimental results comparing the heuristics with the methods
based on the usage of standard graph partitioning libraries.

<P>In <A HREF="#[I2-C-6]">[I2-C-6]</A> the problem of realizing ATM routing
schemes with fixed hop-count and minimum load is addressed. Lower bounds
for the general case and for fixed connection patterns and networks are
presented.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<B>4.&nbsp;<A NAME="Complexity"></A>Complexity and approximation</B></H3>
Due to their intrinsic complexity, for NP-hard optimization problems we
cannot hope to find efficient general solution algorithms and we need to
restrict ourselves to approximate solutions. Hence, the study of approximate
algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems has a considerable importance
both from the theoretical point of view and with respect to the practical
aim of designing efficient approximation algorithms which are guaranteed
to provide a solution within a maximum relative error. In this area three
research directions are being pursued.

<P>Along the first direction theoretical aspects of approximability have
been studied. In particular the class of problems that can be efficiently
approximated by means of local search algorithms has been studied and a
new and more powerful local search approximation techniques, that generalizes
the standard technique and enlarge the power of this general paradigm,
have been developed <A HREF="#[I2-R-3]">[I2-R-3]</A>. Using these techniques,
in <A HREF="#[I2-C-1]">[I2-C-1]</A> the authors give a fully dynamic 5/2-approximate
algorithm for the class of Maximum binary conjunctive constraint satisfaction
problem, and thus for the Maximum directed cut problem. The proposed algorithm
is based on the non-oblivious local search technique and on a neighborhood
mapping that allows to change either one item, or all the items in the
current solution. Besides, in <A HREF="#[I2-C-3]">[I2-C-3]</A> APX-hardness
results for several optimization problems on cubic and at-most-cubic graphs
that belong to MAX SNP, namely Minimum vertex cover, Maximum independent
set, Minimum dominating set and Maximum cut.

<P>Along the second line, approximation algorithms have been designed for
specific combinatorial problems. Namely, in <A HREF="#[I2-C-2]">[I2-C-2]</A>
the minimum independent dominating set problem in bounded degree graphs
has been studied, and approximate algorithms based on greedy and local
search techniques have been developed. The max and the min weighted satisfiability
problems are variants of the standard max satisfiability problem, in which
every variable is assigned a non-negative weight and one tries to find
a truth assignment satisfying the formula, that maximize or minimize the
sum of the weights of the variables set to true. In <A HREF="#[I2-R-4]">[I2-R-4]</A>
a complete classification of the problems obtained by making restrictions
on the size of variables per clause and on the number of occurrences of
variables in the clauses is given.

<P>Along the third direction, applicative problems have been considered.
In particular, algorithms for integrated prefetching and caching for minimizing
stall time in single and parallel disk systems while moving blocks from
disk to cache are proposed in <A HREF="#[I2-R-2]">[I2-R-2]</A>. In this
work approximation algorithms for the parallel disk case are devised through
a linear programming formulation of the problem. It is also presented the
first polynomial time algorithm for the single disk case, thus settling
a basic open problem in the field. The first approximation algorithms with
performance guarantee for minimizing the total flow time of a set of jobs
released over time in a multiprocessor setting are proposed in <A HREF="#[I2-C-15]">[I2-C-15]</A>.
The total flow time is the overall time spent in the system by a set of
jobs. Approximation algorithms are presented for both the preemptive a
and the non-preemptive case. In <A HREF="#[I2-R-9]">[I2-R-9]</A> the multicast
problem in hierarchical networks with tree topology is studied. Users distributed
in the newtwork ask to be connected to various active multicast groups.
The first algorithms with constant approximation ratio for maximizing the
number of accepted subscriptions without exceeding links capacity are presented
in this paper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<B>5.&nbsp;<A NAME="Online"></A>On-line algorithms</B></H3>
The research on On-line algorithms followed two directions.

<P>Along the first direction, on-line algorithms for network routing problems
are proposed for various network architectures and communication regimes.
In <A HREF="#[I2-B-1]">[I2-B-1]</A> a survey of the main results in the
field it is presented. The first randomized on-line virtual circuit routing
algorithms that achieve both good expected competitive ratio and good variance
are proposed in <A HREF="#[I2-R-7]">[I2-R-7]</A>. The on-line virtual circuit
routing problem is motivated by its application to routing in ATM networks.
This paper presents the first study of the competitive ratio - variance
trade-off for randomized on-line algorithms. On-line algorithms for multicast
communication in trees and meshes topology are presented in <A HREF="#[I2-R-9]">[I2-R-9]</A>.
A set of users distributed in the network issues in an on-line fashion
connection requests to various active multicast groups. The first on-line
algorithms with polylogarithmic competitive ratio for the above mentioned
network topologies are presented for the case of high bandwidth communication
demand. The problem of minimizing the number of wavelength required to
accept a sequence of unicast communication requests in Wavelength Division
Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks is studied in <A HREF="#[I2-C-5]">[I2-C-5]</A>.
Algorithms with optimal competitive ratio are proposed for trees, trees
of rings and meshes topologies. For arbitrary topology networks, efficient
algorithms are proposed when the WDM technology is combined with the Space
Division Multiplexing technology that allows parallel fiber optic links.

<P>A second line of research focused on on-line Scheduling algorithms.
In particular, the first algorithms with optimal competitive ratio for
the problem of minimizing the total flow time of a set of jobs in a multiprocessor
setting when preemption is allowed are presented in <A HREF="#[I2-R-9]">[I2-R-9]</A>
for the on-line version of the problem when jobs are known at their release
times.
