One of the main challenges in the formal modeling of common-sense
reasoning is the ability to cope with the dynamic nature of the
world.   Among the approaches put forward to address this problem
are belief revision and update.   Given a knowledge base T ,
representing our knowledge of the ``state of affairs'' of the
world of interest, it is possible that we are lead to trust
another piece of information P , possibly inconsistent with the
old one T .   The aim of revision and update operators is to
characterize the revised knowledge base T 0that incorporates the
new formula P  into the old one T  while preserving consistency
and, at the same time, avoiding the loss of too much information
in this process.   In this paper we study the computational
complexity, in the propositional case, of one of the main
computational problems of belief revision and update:   deciding
if an interpretation M  is a model of the revised knowledge base.
