DPLL and resolution are two popular methods for solving the
problem of propositional satisfiability.   Rather than algorithms,
they are families of algorithms, as their behavior depend on some
choices they face during execution:   DPLL depends on the choice
of the literal to branch on; resolution depends on the choice of
the pair of clauses to resolve at each step.   The complexity of
making the optimal choice is analyzed in this paper.   Extending
previous results, we prove that choosing the optimal literal to
branch on in DPLL is Delta-log2-hard, and becomes NP&circ;PP-hard
if branching is only allowed on a subset of variables.   Optimal
choice in regular resolution is both NP-hard and CoNP-hard.   The
problem of determining the size of the optimal proofs is also
analyzed:   it is CoNP-hard for DPLL, and Delta-log2-hard if a
conjecture we make is true.   This problem is CoNP-hard for
regular resolution.
