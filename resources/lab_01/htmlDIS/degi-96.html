In this paper we show that it is possible to eliminate the "converse" operator
from the Propositional Dynamic Logic DI (Converse D), without
compromising the soundness and completeness of inference for it. Specifically
we present an encoding of DI formulae into D that eliminates the converse
programs from a DI formula, but adds enough information so as not to
destroy its original meaning with respect to satisfiability, validity, and logical
implication. Notably, the resulting D formula is polynomially related to the
original one. This fact allows for building inference procedures for DI, by
encoding DI formulae into D, and then running an inference procedure for D.
