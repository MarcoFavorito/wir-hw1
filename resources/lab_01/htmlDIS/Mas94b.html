                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>A   strong   analytic  tableau  calculus  is  presentend  for  the  most  common  normal modal logics. The method combines the advantages of both
                   sequent-like  tableaux  and  prefixed  tableaux.  Proper  rules  are
                   used, instead of complex closure operations for the accessibility
                   relation, while non determinism and cut rules, used by sequentlike tableaux, are totally eliminated. A strong completeness theorem without cut is also given for symmetric and euclidean logics.<p>
                   The  system  gains  the  same  modularity  of  Hilbert-style  formulations,  where  the  addition  or  deletion  of  rules  is  the  way  to
                   change logic. Since each rule has to consider only adjacent possible worlds, the calculus also gains efficiency. Moreover, the rules
                   satisfy the strong Church Rosser property and can thus be fully
                   parallelized. Termination properties and a general algorithm are
                   devised. The propositional modal logics thus treated are K, D,


                   T,  KB,  K4,  K5,  K45,  KDB,  D4,  KD5,  KD45,  B,  S4,  S5,  OM,
                   OB, OK4, OS4, OM+ , OB+ , OK4+ , OS4+ . Other logics can be
                   constructed  with  different  combinations  of  the  proposed  rules,
                   but are not presented here.<p>
