<DT> <STRONG> 1 </STRONG>
Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no

 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour
for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that
which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.

Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and
let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon.

For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith
the LORD.

For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
