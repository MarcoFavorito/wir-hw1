Although Knowledge Representation is full of reasoning problems that have
been formally proved to be both NP-hard and coNP-hard, the experimental
analysis has largely focused on problems belonging to either NP or coNP. We
still do not know, for example, whether well-studied phenomena such as
"phase transition", which show up for many NP-complete problems (e.g., sat)
happen for  p2-complete problems, and whether they are related to an
"easy-hard-easy" pattern or not. The goal of this paper is to show some
results of an ongoing experimental analysis that aims to provide reasonable
answers to such questions. We analyze the problem of evaluating Quantified
Boolean Formulae, which is the prototypical complete problem for all levels of
the Polynomial Hierarchy, the computationally simplest hierarchy of
complexity classes above NP of great interest to KR.
