The paper describes an approach to planning within the framework of
description logics. Our proposal is "classic" since it is in the style of deductive
planning and relies upon the reasoning capabilities of description logics, that
are realized in the system Classic. The outcomes of our work are twofold.
From an epistemological point of view our approach is based on the
formalization of actions given by dynamic logics. We take advantage of both
the representational mechanisms provided by description logics and the
introspective capabilities obtained by extending the language with an
epistemic operator. From a practical viewpoint we show how a general
purpose knowledge-based environment, based on description logics, is used in
order to implement an actual agent, the mobile robot "Tino", whose reasoning
tools allow it to derive plans from the knowledge about the environment and
the action specification.
