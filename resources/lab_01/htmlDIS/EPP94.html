                   novel approach to generate prime implicants based on integer programming is presented. A bijection among formulae in conjunctive normal form and 0-1 matrices is established. The problem
                   of finding prime implicants is transformed into an equivalent one
                   that consists in finding the solutions of a set of linear equations
                   with constraints. Thus, this problem is solved by searching for the
                   solution set of an equivalent problem of Integer Programming. A
                   generative  algorithm  which  computes  all  prime  implicants  one
                   at a time is presented. The advantages of such an approach are
                   emphasized by a comparison, based on a significant benchmark,
                   with another method.<p>
