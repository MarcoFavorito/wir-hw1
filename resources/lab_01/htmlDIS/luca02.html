<br>
A <i>property testing</i> algorithm for a graph property P is an algorithm
that, given access to the  representation of a graph G, accepts with high
probability if G has property P, rejects with high probability if G is 
``epsilon-far'' from having property P (that is, one has to change an epsilon fraction of
the representation of G in order to get the representation of a graph with
property P), and may behave arbitrarily in all other cases. The complexity of a
testing problem is very dependent on the representation being used, for example
bipartiteness can be tested in  time depending only on epsilon (specifically, in time
about O(1/epsilon^2)) in the adjacency matrix representation, while it requires sqrt(n) time
in the adjacency list representation, where n is the number of vertices.<br> 
We prove that every property tester for  3-coloring in bounded degree
graphs in the
adjacency list representation must look at Omega(n) entries in the
representation of
the graph. Our proof also shows that no sub-linear time approximation
algorithm can
approximate Max 3SAT to within a factor better than 7/8 (it was known
that no
polynomial-time algorithm could do so, unless P=NP, but our result is
unconditional).
We also show that no algorithm for checking bipartiteness in the
adjacency matrix
representation can have complexity o(1/epsilon^(1.5)), and that no non-
adaptive
algorithm can have complexity o(1/epsilon^2).<p>
 
These results are joint work with Andrej Bogdanov and Kenji Obata
