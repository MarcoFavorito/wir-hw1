                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The   ability   of
                   Database  Systems  to  cope  with  changing  situations  and  information coming from different sources is crucial for their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent work in the field of belief
                   revision and update has provided us tecniques to handle change.<p>
                   In this paper we introduce a different form of revision aiming at
                   capturing the process of "merging" possibly inconsistent pieces of
                   information. We call this process arbitration. Along the lines of
                   Gardenfors' work, we propose a set of postulates for this operator
                   and prove a representation theorem.<p>
