Abduction is one of the most important forms of reasoning and it
has been successfully applied to several practical problems such
as diagnosis.   In this paper we investigate whether the
computational complexity of abduction can be reduced by an
appropriate use of preprocessing or compilation.   This is
motivated by the fact that part of the data of the problem
(namely, the set of all possible assumptions and the theory
relating assumptions and manifestations) are often known before
the rest of the problem.   We present a detailed analysis of the
computational complexity of abduction when compilation is
allowed.
