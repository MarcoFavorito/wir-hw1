        in Computer Science in 1997 at the University of Rome &quot;La Sapienza&quot;. 
        He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science in February 2001 from the same 
        University. He has been visiting scientist at the AT&amp;T Research Laboratories 
        (Florham Park, NJ, USA), joining the Networks Group, and at the Theory 
        Group of the IT University of Copenhagen. He has been consultant at Microsoft 
        Research - Silicon Valley. He is currently Assistant Professor in Computer 
        Science at the University of Rome &quot;La Sapienza&quot;. His research 
        interests include the design, analysis, and engineering of algorithms 
        for combinatorial problems. His scientific results include both theoretical 
        and applied contributions. He has solved long-standing open problems on 
        graphs and has designed and implemented several software systems for algorithm 
        engineering and visualization. His results appeared in prestigious venues 
        such as Journal of the ACM, IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer 
        Science, and ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. His was recipient of 
        the 2001 EATCS Italian Chapter Award for the best two Ph.D. Theses in 
        Theoretical Computer Science. He has organized several scientific events, 
        including the 45th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science. 
        He is continuously invited to join the program committees of international 
        conferences and has been recently co-chair of the 2005 ACM-SIAM Workshop 
        on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments.</font></p>
