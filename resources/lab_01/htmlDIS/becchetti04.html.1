Traditional competitive analysis fails to explain important properties     of paging assessed by practical experience. In particular, the competitive     ratios of paging algorithms that are known to be efficient in practice (e.g.     LRU) are as poor as those of naive heuristics (e.g. FWF). It has been recognized     that the main reason for these discrepancies lies in an unsatisfactory modelling     of locality of reference exhibited by real request sequences. With paging     as one of the motivating applications, many extensions to competitive analysis     have been proposed in the recent past. Among the most interesting ones, the     diffuse adversary proposed by Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou forces the adversary     to generate request sequences according to properly defined families of probability     distributions. The speficic adversary they propose, however, does not explicitly     model locality of reference. We explicitely address this issue, proposing     an adversarial model in which the probability of requesting a page is also     a function of the page's age. In this way, our approach allows to capture     the effect of locality of reference. We consider several families of distributions     and we prove that the competitive ratio of LRU becomes constant as locality     increases, as expected. This result is strengthened when the distribution     satisfies a further concavity/convexity property: in this case, the competitive     ratio of LRU is always constant. We also propose a family of distributions     parametrized by locality of reference and we prove that the performance of     FWF rapidly degrades as locality increases, while the converse happens for     LRU.</P>  <BR>  &nbsp; <BR>  &nbsp; <BR>  &nbsp;   <p></P></DL>
