Description logics (also called terminological logics, or concept languages) are
fragments of first-order logic that provide a formal account of the basic
features of frame-based systems.  However, there are aspects of frame-based
systems_such as nonmonotonic reasoning and procedural rules_that cannot
be characterized in a standard first-order framework.  Such features are needed
for real applications, and a clear understanding of the logic underlying them is
necessary for principled implementations.  We show how description logics
enriched with an epistemic operator can formalize such aspects.  The logic
obtained is a fragment of a first-order nonmonotonic modal logic.  We show
that the epistemic operator formalizes procedural rules, as provided in many
knowledge representation systems, and enables sophisticated query
formulation, including various forms of closed-world reasoning.  We provide an
effective procedure for answering epistemic queries posed to a knowledge base
expressed in a description logic and extend this procedure in order to deal
with rules.  We also address the computational complexity of reasoning with
the epistemic operator, identifying cases in which an appropriate use of the
epistemic operator can help in decreasing the complexity of reasoning.
