                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>KAAD  is  a  support  system  for  architectural  design  based  on  a  new  methodology that makes it a real and effective support for the design
                   activity seen as the process leading to the definition of a physical form where a predefined set of required functions could be


                   accomplished. This type of activity has three characteristic aspects:  definition of the functional services required (objectives),
                   production of design solutions and evaluation of the services provided in relation to the predefined objectives. KAAD is a system
                   aiming at supporting all the three mentioned phases of design, by
                   building a Knowledge Base of architectural objects. It refers to a
                   simple frame-based language that has turned out to be very well
                   suited for the purposes of the system. Both generation and verification of design solutions are supported by the same knowledge
                   base.<p>
