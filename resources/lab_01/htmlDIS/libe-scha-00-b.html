One of the main challenges in the formal modeling of common-sense
reasoning is the ability to cope with the dynamic nature of the
world.   Among the approaches put forward to address this problem
are belief revision and update.   Given a knowledge base T ,
representing our knowledge of the ``state of affairs'' of the
world of interest, we are often led to trust another piece of
information P , possibly conflicting with the old one T .   The aim
of revision and update operators is to characterize the revised
knowledge base T 0that incorporates the new formula P  into the
old one T  while preserving consistency and, at the same time,
avoiding the loss of too much information.   In this paper we
study the ability of belief revision semantics in compactly
representing the set of models of the updated knowledge base.
