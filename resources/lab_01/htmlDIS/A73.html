  The paper discusses the architecture of a Reactive Agent, capable of carrying out autonomous navigation. The agent extends the artificial potential field approach, used for trajectory formation, to environment exploration and symbolic feature detection. The agent's capabilities range from obstacle avoidance to maze navigation, carried out autonomously or under the supervision of higher cognitive levels.
