<h1>Stereo Vision</h1>

<p>Robotic systems are becoming smaller, lower power, and cheaper,
enabling their application in areas not previously considered.  This
is true of vision systems as well.  SRI's Small Vision Module (SVM) is
a compact, inexpensive realtime device for computing dense stereo
range images, which are a fundamental measurement supporting a wide
range of computer vision applications.  In this talk, I will give an
overview of hardware and software issues in the construction of the
SVM, and describe several ongoing projects that take advantage of
stereo processing, including realtime people-tracking.</p>
