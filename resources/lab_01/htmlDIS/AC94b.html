                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The  DRS  (Data
                   Relay Satellite) System is a European Space Agency communication system whose management is particularly complex. This
                   paper describes the basic algorithm and the main heuristics used
                   by the DRS-Sched a knowledge-based scheduler aimed at solving a conspicuous aspect of the whole DRS scheduling problem.<p>
                   The particular problem model addressed represents a peculiarity
                   of the DRS-Sched. In particular,  the activities to be scheduled
                   have a temporal flexibility over both their allocation and duration
                   intervals. Problem solving in DRS-Sched integrates domain specific predictive scheduling heuristics and reactive heuristics that
                   try to improve the current schedule by locally modifying previous choices. An experimental evaluation demonstrates how the
                   system satisfies quality requirements connected to the following
                   relevant aspects: the satisfaction of the strong role played by the
                   priority in the DRS domain; the intelligent manipulation of the


                   particular DRS's activities; the implementation of the ability to
                   flexibly orient the system towards different optimum objectives.<p>
