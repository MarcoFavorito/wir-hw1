                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Our  goal  in  this
                   paper  is  to  highlight  the  connection  between  modal  provability  theory  and  default  logic.  We  propose  KD4Z  as  the  modal
                   provability  logic  that  can  express  default  reasoning.  We  give  a
                   systematic  translation  of  default  theories  into  modal  formulas.<p>
                   Then, a suitable self-referencial sentence is associated with a default theory. This sentence contains a propositional paramater,
                   which acts as the context in default logic. Modal formulas that
                   substituted for the parameter make this sentence a theorem correspond to Reiter extensions. Hence, KD4Z characterizes default
                   logic: it is an amalgamated formalism that allows formulas of the
                   language to represent metalogical constructions. Differently from
                   the "negation as failure to prove" paradigm, in which families of
                   modal logics can be used to embedd default logics, the proposed
                   "modal provability" approach leads to a single logic.<p>
