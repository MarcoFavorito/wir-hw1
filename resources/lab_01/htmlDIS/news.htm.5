<P>There appear to be two new files on the ftp site, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/beta/MesaLib-3.1beta3.tar.gz">MesaLib-3.1beta3.tar.gz</A>
and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.mesa3d.org/mesa/beta/MesaDemos-3.1beta3.tar.gz">MesaDemos-3.1beta3.tar.gz</A>,
that seem to be... yes, I've just received confirmation from the beta center, they
are indeed the <B>THIRD</B> beta release of Mesa 3.1! Happy Days. Happy Days. Thanks
Keith Whitwell for preparing these for us during Brian's absence.</P>

<P>I'm pleased to announce that I've accepted a position with Precision Insight,
Inc. effective October, 1999. I'll be leaving Avid Technology in September.</P>
<P>I've been working on Mesa in my spare time for over five years. With Precision
Insight I now have the opportunity to devote my full attention to advancing Mesa
and OpenGL on Linux.</P>
<P>While I'll be focused on Linux, the X Window System, and hardware acceleration,
my work will continue to be open sourced and available to any other programmers who
may want to contribute to it, or use it for other projects or platforms</P>
<P>PS: I'm going to be traveling until Sep 6 and won't be reading email until then.</P>

Note that this is a new archive, so you will need to re-checkout the archive. That
means don't <I>cvs update</I> from a previous download.</P>

<PRE>May 1999 - John Carmack of id Software, Inc. has made a donation of
US$10,000 to the Mesa project to support its continuing development.
Mesa is a free implementation of the OpenGL 3D graphics library and id's
newest game, Quake 3 Arena, will use Mesa as the 3D renderer on Linux.

The donation will go to Keith Whitwell, who has been optimizing Mesa to
improve performance on 3d hardware.  Thanks to Keith's work, many
applications using Mesa 3.1 will see a dramatic performance increase
over Mesa 3.0.  The donation will allow Keith to continue working on
Mesa full time for some time to come.

For more information about Mesa see www.mesa3d.org.  For more
information about id Software, Inc. see www.idsoftware.com.
