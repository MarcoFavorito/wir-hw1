                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Several  methods
                   are  proposed,  in  the  past  years,  to  attempt  to  define  how  to
                   deal  with  a  dynamic  knowledge.  From  a  computational  point
                   of view, different definitions lead to different different computational property, namely to a complexity between  p2to  p3in the
                   polynomial hierarchy. Restricting the analysis to cases in which
                   some operations becomes tractable (Horn case), other problems
                   arises. We show that,  providing some assumption on the polynomial hierarchy, many update operators are uncompactable, ie
                   it is impossible to find a representation of the result without an
                   exponential-size explosion. We supply also the explicit representations of the updates for which it is possible.<p>
