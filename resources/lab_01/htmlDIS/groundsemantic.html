<H2> Abstract </H2>

In this paper we provide a semantic characterization of ground logics, a
family of nonmonotonic modal logics obtained by means of a variant of the
well known Mc Dermott and Doyle fixed point equation. The term ground
logics carries the idea of restricting the negative introspection
capabilities of the reasoning agent to the objective (i.e. non-modal) part
of the theory.  This intuition was nicely formalized for modal logic S5 by
a semantic definition based on a preference relation on Kripke models,
which was obtained as the semantic counterpart to the notion of minimal
knowledge initially defined by Halpern and Moses.  We have then found a
preference relation on Kripke models that both generalizes this notion of
minimal knowledge and provides a semantic characterization for a
significant subset of ground logics.
