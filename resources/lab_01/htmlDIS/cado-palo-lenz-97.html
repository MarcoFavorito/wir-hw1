Recently there was some attention on integration of description logics of the
AL -family with rule-based languages for querying relational databases such as
Datalog, so as to achieve the best characteristics of both kinds of formalisms
in a common framework. Formal analysis on such hybrid languages has been
limited to computational complexity: i.e., how much time/space it is needed to
answer to a specific query? This paper carries out a different formal analysis,
the one dealing with expressiveness, which gives precise characterization of the
concepts definable as queries. We first analyze the applicability to hybrid
languages of formal tools developed for characterizing the expressive power of
relational query languages. We then present some preliminary results on the
expressiveness of hybrid languages. In particular, we show that relatively
simple hybrid languages are able to define all finite structures expressed by
skolemized universally quantified second-order formulae with some constraints
on the quantified predicates.
