                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The  timetabling
                   problem consists in fixing a sequence of meetings between teachers and students in a prefixed period of time (typically a week),
                   satisfying a set of constraints of various types. A large number
                   of  variants  of  the  timetabling  problem  have  been  proposed  in


                   the  literature,  which  differ  from  each  other  based  on  the  type
                   of institution involved (university or high school) and the type
                   of constraints. This problem, that has been traditionally considered in the operational research field, has recently been tackled
                   with techniques belonging also to artificial intelligence (e.g. genetic algorithms, tabu search, and simulated annealing). In this
                   paper,  we survey the various formulations of the problem,  and
                   the techniques and algorithms used for its solution.<p>
