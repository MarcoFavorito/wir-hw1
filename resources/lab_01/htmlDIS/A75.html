  FW_rules is a Prolog library which provides efficient support for forward
  (reactive) rules in Prolog. The library is based on an indexing mechanism to
  achieve efficiency. The library supports interoperability between the forward
  chaining language and the underlying Prolog engine and it can be embedded
  in any Prolog application. The implementation is based on a runtime
  support written in C to perform indexing efficiently, and it rely on Prolog for
  the evaluation of rules. In this paper we describe the library, the compiler
  and the indexing mechanism. Finally, we compare FW_rules with other
  approaches to the implementation of production rules in Prolog and with
  other public-domain production systems, presenting a set of benchmarks.
