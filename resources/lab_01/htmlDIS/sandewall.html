<P><FONT COLOR="#191970">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV's) offer an interesting
challenge for intelligent robotic systems, and in particular for reasoning
about actions and change. The UAV itself needs to deliberate on its maneuvering,
knowledge acquisition, and communication actions. Depending on the type
of application of the UAV, it may also have to deliberate on the actions
of fellow UAV's, vehicles or other devices that it observes on the ground,
and communication partners. In this talk I will discuss how our approach
to reasoning about actions and change has been (1) utilized and (2) influenced
by our participation in the WITAS project, which is an ongoing, large research
effort for the development of information technologies for autonomous and
intelligent UAV's.</FONT></P>
