  In this paper a learning system is presented that is able to learn both the
  syntax (from an over-generalized grammar) and semantic rules (containing
  threshold values and relations) of an ECG grammar. These rules are used to
  direct the classification of QRS complexes and to distinquish between QRS
  and non-QRS patterns. The system demonstrates how a theory revision
  method can be used to refine large Prolog programs.
