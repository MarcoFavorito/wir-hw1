<H2> Abstract </H2>

We consider the epistemic concept language proposed in [Donini et al.,
KR-92], which has been used to formalize procedural rules and weak
definitions using a very restricted form of epistemic sentences. Our
statement is that there are a number of other uses of the epistemic
operator that require different forms of epistemic sentences in the
knowledge base. To justify this statement we briefly recall the epistemic
language ALCK, then address the formalization of defaults, and provide
examples of assertions including epistemic operators in the construct for
universal quantification on roles and in the scope of existential
quantification on roles.
