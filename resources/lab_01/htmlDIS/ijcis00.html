<h1>Data Integration in Data Warehousing</h1>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p>

Information integration is one of the most important aspects of a Data
Warehouse.  When data passes from the sources of the application-oriented
operational environment to the Data Warehouse, possible inconsistencies and
redundancies should be resolved, so that the warehouse is able to provide
an integrated and reconciled view of data of the organization.  We describe
a novel approach to data integration in Data Warehousing. Our approach is
based on a conceptual representation of the Data Warehouse application
domain, and follows the so-called local-as-view paradigm: both source and
Data Warehouse relations are defined as views over the conceptual model.
We propose a technique for declaratively specifying suitable reconciliation
correspondences to be used in order to solve conflicts among data in
different sources. The main goal of the method is to support the design of
mediators that materialize the data in the Data Warehouse relations.
Starting from the specification of one such relation as a query over the
conceptual model, a rewriting algorithm reformulates the query in terms of
both the source relations and the reconciliation correspondences, thus
obtaining a correct specification of how to load the data in the
materialized view.
