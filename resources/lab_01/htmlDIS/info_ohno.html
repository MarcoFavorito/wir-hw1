<a href="pres/ohno.ppt">Download the presentation (PPT, PowerPoint)</a><br/>

<p>URG-X002 is a high accuracy laser range scanner with a very compact design developed by Hokuyo Automatic Co., Ltd. It is the world's smallest range scanner of its class invented with our advanced cutting edge technology.</p>
<p>It is a highly reliable sensor used for obstacle detection, environment recognition and path planning in robotics. URG-X002 provides the best solution for any mobile robotic platform because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a highly compact design. Size of the URG-X002 is 50mm(width)×50mm(breadth)×70mm(height) with the weight just 160 grams. Attachment at any part of robot is simple and easier than the any other bulky sensors in the market.</li>
<li>It has a wide detection area. URG-X002 scans in the angular range of 270° with distance up to 4 meters. Map building is made easier.</li>
<li>High angular resolution of 0.36° and accuracy ±10mm. Detection of thin obstacle in the robots path as well the distance to the obstacle is measured accurately.</li>
<li>Low power consumption. Input voltage is 5 Volts and current is 500 milli-Amperes with the power consumption 2.5 Watts.</li>
<li>Equipped with both USB and Serial communication. Convenient for multiple sensor attachments.</li>
<li>Less than half the price of any other sensor of this type.</li>
</ul>
