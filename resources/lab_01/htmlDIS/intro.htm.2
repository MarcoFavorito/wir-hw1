Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to that of <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org"
target="_parent">OpenGL</A>.* To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command
syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com"
target="_parent">Silicon Graphics, Inc.</A>(SGI). However, the author does not possess
an OpenGL license from SGI, and makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a compatible
replacement for OpenGL or associated with SGI. Those who want a licensed implementation
of OpenGL should contact a licensed vendor. <BR>
<BR>
While Mesa is not a licensed OpenGL implementation, it is currently being tested
with the OpenGL conformance tests. For the current conformance status see the <TT><CODE>CONFORM</CODE></TT>
file included in the Mesa distribution. Despite these technical/legal terms, you
may find Mesa to be a valid alternative to OpenGL. Most applications written for
OpenGL can use Mesa instead without changing the source code. <BR>
<BR>
Please do not refer to the library as <EM>MesaGL</EM> (for legal reasons). It's just
<EM>Mesa</EM> or <EM>The Mesa 3-D graphics library</EM>. <BR>

Graphics Incorporated</A>.

Mesa is primarily developed and maintained on a volunteer basis.
Some Mesa development work has been done in conjuction with contracted
projects, such as the XFree86/DRI drivers.

If you have a need for specific or custom Mesa development work,
<A HREF="http://www.tungstengraphics.com" target="_parent">
