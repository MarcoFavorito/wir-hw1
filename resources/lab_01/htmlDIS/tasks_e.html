				The project is articulated in three tasks:<br />
				1. Simulation tools for rescue scenarios<br />
				2. Robotic systems for rescue operations<br />
				3. Integration and experimentation<br />
<br />
Task T1: Simulation Tools for rescue scenarios<br />
<br />
The goal of this task is to design simulation tools that include both human and robotic agents and visualize their operations in a simulation scenario. The building block for this task is the RoboCup Rescue Simulator and its extension, developed in cooperation by two of the project members. The task is further organized in two subtasks and is carried out by in collaboration by the units of politecnico di Milano and Roma "La Sapienza":<br />
<br />
T1A) Integration of robotic agents in the RoboCup Rescue Simulator (together with human agents like police, firemen and medical aids), with the task of saving victims in a simulated rescue scenario. This task will also require the model of the indoor domain correspondin to the robot rescue arenas.<br />
<br />
T1B) Modeling and 3D real time visualization of the rescue operation, which provides both a tools for evaluating the performance of simulated agents and to analyse the behaviour of robotic agents. In particular the visual model will address several elements of a urban domain, including indoor scenarios that correspond to the robot rescue arenas.<br />
<br />
Task T2 Robotic systems for rescue operations<br />
<br />
The goal of this task is to design robotic systems that can explore a rescue scenario and find the victims. The basis for this task is constituted by the team of robots already developed at Roma "La Sapienza", for various indoor tasks. The reference for testing the performance of the systems will be the standard Rescue Arenas (see Task T3). The task is further organized in two subtasks and is carried out by in collaboration by the units of "La Sapienza" and Roma 3:<br />
<br />
T2A) Method and Techniques. While the technical issues that can must be tackled in order to build rescue robots are manifold, in the context of the present project we will focus our attention on two problems:<br />
- coordination and cooperative perception for exploration and victim identification <br />
- localization and mapping via reinforcement learning<br />
T2B) Realization on robotic bases. The effectiveness of the technical solution proposed for the problems addressed in Task T1A) will be verified by embodying them into robotic systems that can explore the test arenas mapping the environment and detecting the victims.<br />
<br />
Task T3 Integration and experimentation<br />
<br />
The goal of this task is to integrate thw work carried out in the T1 and T2 in a single harware software test scenario implemented at Istituto Superiore Antincendi (ISA-Roma). The basic reference for testing the performance of the systems will be the standard Rescue Arenas (see Task T3), and for the simulation system a enlarged urban scenario. The task is further organized in three subtasks, that are carried out by in collaboration by all the project units:<br />
<br />
3A) Specification and set up of the test arena at ISA: the test arenas (designed at NIST) allow for the real simulation of disaster scenarios that can be used for training robotic systems whose task is to explore an unknown environment and find victims. Test arenas are populated with mannequins that simulate the victims. Details on the test arenas and on the mannequins are given below. <br />
<br />
3B) Experimentation of the rescue simulator, on a virtual urban scenarion including a model of the test arenas and of the robotic agents.<br />
 <br />
3C) Experimentation of the robotic systems implemented in the test arena. In particular, according to the development of T2 two types of systems will be delivered:<br />
- Multi-robot system exploiting the advantages of a coordinated approach to the exploration and victim search task.<br />
- Single robot system showing the mapping capabilities achieved with a learning approach<br />
<br />
In the final part of the project the integration of the two robotic subsystem will also be accomplished. The performance of the robotic systems will be evaluated according to the criteria for mapping and victim detection as suggested by the Real Robots RoboCup Rescue competitions.<br />
<br />
<b>Competence and Collaboration among the units</b><br />
<br />
The project is concerned with an application (support tools for search and rescue operations), where the complexity of the problem requires a variety of competences, certainly including those of the experts in the field of emergency and rescue operations.<br />
To this end the research group provides specific competences in the field of 3D modeling and simulation (Politecnico di Milano) of intelligent systems for robotic applications (Roma "La Sapienza") and automated reasoning (Roma3). Moreover, as described below, the project takes advantage of the collaboration with Istituto Superiore Antincendi, concerning both  the displacement of the arenas for the robots and the specific competences on the problems of emergengy and rescue operations. The present project stems from a previous experience concerning a project developed in collaboratin with the Firemen Department (see http://www.dis,uniroma1.it/soccorsi), which led to a first group of results on the simulation systems and has provided the framework for a larger collaboration in the implementation of the test arenas for the robots.<br />
