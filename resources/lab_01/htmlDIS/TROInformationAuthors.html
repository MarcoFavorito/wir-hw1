<p>The <b><i>IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS </i></b>
publishes fundamental scientific papers dealing with all aspects of robotics. 
Specifically involved are aspects of the following areas as they relate to the field: Kinematics, dynamics, control,
 modeling and simulation of robots and intelligent machines and systems; manipulation, grasping, and dexterous hands;
 design of robotic mechanisms; and mathematical and computational issues in robotics.
 Intelligent robotic instrumentation and measurement; vision and other non-contact sensors; tactile and other
 contact sensing systems; sensor integration, fusion, and perception; and mechatronics. 
Assembly and task planning; teleoperation and telerobotics; haptics; robot motion planning, path and 
trajectory planning, localization and navigation; mobile and autonomous robotics; legged locomotion;
 micro- and nano-robotics; and cellular, distributed, and cooperating robotics. Robotics in industry, manufacturing,
 and flexible automation; and linkages to computer-aided design, engineering, and information systems.
 Robotics in unstructured environments, including service and household systems, medical systems, construction systems,
 space and unmanned air systems, underwater systems, and intelligent vehicle and highway systems.
 Robotics application methodologies such as control, learning, hybrid systems, mathematical optimization,
 artificial intelligence, neural networks, and fuzzy systems. Robotics and intelligent system-related computer
 hardware, software, and architectures; advanced programming languages and software development environments;
 virtual reality; and human–robot interface and integration.

<p>The bimonthly <b><i> IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS </i></b>publishes Regular Papers, Short Papers, Communications Items, and Book
 Reviews. Short Papers usually describe a single result, experiment, or technique of general interest for which 
a short treatment is appropriate. Communications Items are a separate class of short manuscripts that are subject
 to an expedited review process. Appropriate items include (but are not limited to) rebuttals and/or counterexamples
 of previously published papers. Normally, the editors will review these submissions internally, although they will
 request outside review when appropriate. Book Reviews of special interest to Robotics are considered and reviewed similarly. 

<p>Review papers are published periodically, and unsolicited manuscripts of a tutorial or review nature are welcome. 
It would be advisable for prospective authors of such papers to contact the Editor-in-Chief in advance of submission concerning probable interest. Papers describing specific current (industrial and beyond) applications are encouraged, provided that the designs represent the best current practice, detailed characteristics and performance are included, and they are of general interest. Multipart papers will only be published if there is compelling rationale for a multipart treatment. All parts of such submissions must be accepted for any part to be published.


<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Submission"></a><b>Submission of Manuscripts</b>
<p>Manuscripts should be original, previously unpublished work, and not simultaneously under consideration for
 publication elsewhere. The material, if accepted, should be properly available for general dissemination to the 
readership. It is the responsibility of the authors, not the IEEE, to determine whether disclosure of their material 
requires the prior consent of other parties and, if so, to obtain it. If authors make use of charts, photographs, or
 other graphical or textual material from previously published material, the authors are responsible for obtaining 
written permission to use the material in the manuscript.

<p>The <b><i> IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS </i></b> handles only electronic submissions of papers in PDF, 
postscript, or zipped postscript form. Papers should be submitted by FTP to the site address 
<a 
href="ftp://ftp.dis.uniroma1.it/pub/ieeetro/incoming">ftp.dis.uniroma1.it/pub/ieeetro/incoming</a>. 
The cover page of the paper should contain the paper title,
 authors’ names and full addresses, abstract, keywords (index terms), and paper type 
(Regular Paper, Short Paper, Communication Item, or Book Review). 
The corresponding author should be clearly indicated. A submission letter has to be sent
 by email to <a href="mailto:ieeetro@dis.uniroma1.it">ieeetro@dis.uniroma1.it</a> including (as plain text in the message) all information contained 
in the cover page of the paper and the name of the uploaded file(s). Detailed information on electronic
 submission procedures can be found at <a 
href="http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/ieeetro/TROElectronicSubmission.html">http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/ieeetro/TROElectronicSubmission.html</a>.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Copyright"></a><b>Copyright</b><o:p></o:p>
<p>It is the policy of the IEEE to own the copyright to the technical contributions it publishes on behalf 
of the interests of the IEEE, its authors, and their employers, and to facilitate the appropriate reuse 
of this material by others. To comply with U.S. copyright law, authors are required to sign an IEEE copyright 
transfer form with the manuscript. This form, downloadable from 
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/about/documentation/copyright/IEEECForm121302pdf.pdf">
http://www.ieee.org/portal/cms_docs/about/documentation/copyright/IEEECForm121302pdf.pdf</a>, 
returns to authors and their employers full rights to reuse their material for their own purposes.


<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Ethical"></a><b>Ethical Issues</b><o:p></o:p>
<p>IEEE defines plagiarism as the use of someone else’s prior ideas, processes, results, or words without 
explicitly acknowledging the original author and source. Plagiarism in any form is unacceptable and is considered 
a serious breach of professional conduct, with potentially severe ethical and legal consequences. 

<p>Self-plagiarism is also unethical. If authors have used their own previously published work(s) as a basis 
for a new submission, they are required to cite the previous work(s) and very briefly indicate how the new 
submission offers substantively novel contributions beyond those of the previously published work(s). 
 
<p>Multiple submissions to different journals are unacceptable. This applies to the whole period in which
 a paper is under review for the <b><i> IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS</i></b>. It is a task of the authors to clearly 
spell out differences of their submitted papers with similar content. Any common part should be clearly 
cited. Please, contact the Editor-in-Chief in case of doubts.


<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Style"></a><b>Style of 
Manuscripts</b><o:p></o:p>
<p>1) Manuscripts should be submitted in a double column format using an
IEEE style file (downloadable from <a 
href="http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.htm">
http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/stylesheets.html</a>).
Regular papers are limited to <b>ten <i> TRANSACTIONS</i></b> pages and Short papers to <b>five<i> TRANSACTIONS</i></b> pages, with mandatory page charges imposed on extra pages
(see Page Charges below). Excessively long papers may be rejected without
review.
<p>2) The cover page should contain the paper title and each author's name,
affiliation, and full address (mailing address, fax number, and email address),
with the corresponding author clearly indicated. This page should also
contain the abstract (no more than 200 words for Regular Papers and 50
words for Short Papers or Communications Items), keywords, and the type
of the paper (Regular Paper, Short Paper, Communication Item, or Book Review).
<p>3) All figures must be numbered and cited in text. After acceptance,
the following will be required. All line drawings (graphs, charts, diagrams,
etc.) should be prepared on a white background in black ink. Lettering
should be large enough to be readily legible when the drawing is reduced
to two or one-column width - as much as 4:1 reduction from the original.
Photographs should be glossy prints of high contrast, without spurious
marks. Include a separate list of figure captions with the manuscript.
Original illustrations and photographs must be sent upon acceptance of
the paper.
<p>4) References must be in a separate reference section at the end of
the paper, with items referred to by numerals in square brackets. References
must be completed in IEEE style as follows:
<p>Author(s), first initials followed by last name, title in quotation
marks, periodical, volume, inclusive page numbers, month and year.
<p>Books: Author(s), first initials followed by last name, title, location,
publisher, year, chapter, page numbers.
<p>5) Authors of regular papers are requested to send current biographies
(no more than 100 words) and recent photographs at the time of paper 
acceptance.
<p>6) Galley-proofs of accepted articles will be sent in pdf format to the corresponding
author. For further information, see "Information for IEEE Transactions
and Journal Authors," downloadable from <a 
href="http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/information.html">
http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/transactions/information.html</a>.

<br>&nbsp;<p><a NAME="Keywords"></a><b>Keywords Selection&nbsp;</b><o:p></o:p>
<p>A list of few significant keywords (also named index terms) should be included in
 the cover page of each submitted paper. To select appropriate keywords, you may use
 the general IEEE list of keywords available at 
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/ani_prod/keywrd98.txt">
http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/ani_prod/keywrd98.txt</a> and/or look at those used
 in papers already published in the <b><i> TRANSACTIONS</i></b> on similar topics. 

<br>&nbsp;<p><a NAME="PDF"></a><b>PDF File Testing&nbsp;</b><o:p></o:p>
<p>Sometimes, pdf files generated with software or operative systems of Far East
 countries may embed Chinese/Japanese/Korean fonts that cannot be shown on screen or 
printed correctly with standard Western system configurations. Although at the Editor-in-Chief’s 
office software extensions are available allowing to work properly with such pdf files, we
 cannot expect that all reviewers will be equipped in a similar way. This would result in 
a successive request to the corresponding author for a modified electronic file, 
slowing down the review process. 

<p>Therefore, authors should carefully generate their pdf files and are urged to check,
 before submission, IEEE printability by using the web facility available 
at <a href="https://www.paperplaza.net/scripts/pdftest.pl">https://www.paperplaza.net/scripts/pdftest.pl</a>.
 You will be asked to upload your
 pdf file and the test requires only few seconds. Please, look only at that part of 
the report possibly indicating font embedding problems (not at the paper formatting, 
page margins, A4 page size, paper length etc.).


<br>&nbsp;<p><a NAME="PageCharges"></a><b>Page 
Charges&nbsp;</b><o:p></o:p>
<p>A mandatory page charge is imposed on all Regular Papers whose length
exceeds <b>ten<i>
TRANSACTIONS</i></b> pages including illustrations. This charge
is $175 per page of each page over the first ten based on the final typeset
length and not on manuscript length, and is a prerequisite for publication.
The same policy applies to Short Papers and Communication Items exceeding
<b>five<i>
TRANSACTIONS</i></b> pages.
<p>A voluntary page charge form ($110/page) is sent to the authors with
proofs, and the author is encouraged, whenever possible, to make a contribution
to defray part of the publication cost. Authors receive 100 free reprints
if the charge is honored.<br>&nbsp;
