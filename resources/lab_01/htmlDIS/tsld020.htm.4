<P><LI><H2>A transaction might commit after completing all its actions, or it could abort (or be aborted by the DBMS) after executing some actions.

<P><LI><H2>A very important property guaranteed by the DBMS for all transactions is that they are atomic.  That is, a user can think of a Xact as always executing all its actions in one step, or not executing any actions at all.

<P><LI>DBMS logs all actions so that it can undo the actions of aborted transactions.

<P><LI><H2>This ensures that if each Xact preserves consistency, every serializable schedule preserves consistency. </H2></P>
