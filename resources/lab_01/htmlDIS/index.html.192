    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Azzurra Robot Team (ART) is
    the result of a joint effort of six Italian research groups from
    Univ. of Genova, Politecnico Milano, Univ. of Padova, Univ. of
    Palermo, Univ. of Parma, Univ. Roma &quot;La Sapienza&quot;,
    and Consorzio Padova Ricerche which has provided resources and
    a set up of the soccer field in its Center in Padova. We have
    developed the team within the framework of the RoboCup Italia
    Project, with the aim of education and training of students in
    the subjects related to the design of autonomous mobile robots,
    of developing new research ideas and foster the development of
    larger projects in this field in Italy.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Azzurra Robot Team (ART) is
    the National Italian Team for F-2000 RoboCup league, developed
    within the framework of the RoboCup Italia project, and for RoboCup-99
    ART is formed by six academic groups and the Consorzio Padova
    Ricerche. The goal of the project is to exploit the expertise
    and ideas from all groups in order to build a team where players
    have different features, both hardware and software, but retain
    the ability to coordinate their behaviour within the team. Therefore,
    the ART team includes several types of players, that are built
    on top of two hardware bases: baseART and <I>Mo</I><SUP>2</SUP><I>Ro</I>.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Below we provide a short description
    of the two basic architectures, and subsequently we shall address
    each type of player. Finally we shall address the research problems
    that are tackled by every unit of the team.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000"></A><FONT SIZE="+2"
     FACE="Verdana">Robotic bases</FONT></H1>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Presently, we are using two
    robotic bases: BaseART and <I>Mo</I><SUP>2</SUP><I>Ro</I> which
    are described below.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000"></A><FONT SIZE="+1"
     FACE="Verdana">BaseART</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">BaseART was developed in preparation
    to the 1998 RoboCup by assembling several out-of-the-shelf, low-cost
    components, with the goal of keeping it very standard in terms
    of hardware and, therefore, easily extensible with new devices.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The first building block is
    constituted by the Pioneer 1 mobile basis and the second is constituted
    by a conventional PC, running LINUX, for onboard computing. We
    have reached a compromise between weight and power consumption,
    where the player has enough autonomy to play games.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The third component is constituted
    by a wireless high bandwidth connection that we consider necessary
    to have a development environment that allows the programmer
    operating on a standard platform (connected to the robot) to
    obtain accurate information about the situation onboard. The
    wireless connection supports also the exchange of information
    among the players, but it is not currently used to transfer raw
    data among the players.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The fourth component is the
    vision system which is constituted by a low-cost frame grabber
    based on the BT848. At RoboCup 99 we have used a Sony XC-999P
    color camera with about 100<SUP><I>o</I></SUP> aperture angle.
    The cameras are positioned differently on different types of
    players.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The fifth component is a kicking
    device driven by air pressure, with two actuators that can enable
    the player to kick left or right or straight (when both kickers
    are activated at the same time).</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Mo</FONT></I><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Verdana"><SUP>2</SUP><I>Ro</I> is a <I>Mo</I>dular <I>Mo</I>bile
    <I>Ro</I>bot base designed and implemented at Politecnico di
    Milano Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab. When we decided
    to build it, we needed a general purpose robot to match the RoboCup
    specifications, but also the needs of other projects in our lab.
    <I>Mo</I><SUP>2</SUP><I>Ro</I> can run up to 60 cm/sec, and may
    have more then 40 kg as payload. The hardware is functionally
    layered, and any module can be easily added or removed. At the
    first level, we have mounted, in the different implementations
    of <I>Mo</I><SUP>2</SUP><I>Ro</I>: a sonar belt, bumpers, encoders,
    and different vision sensors; among these: two different types
    of omnidirectional sensors [<A HREF="art.html#BonarinietAl:99">3</A>],
    and a camera mounted on top of a 5 DOF arm. Among the actuators
    that we have adopted up to now we have two DC motors for movement,
    a kicker, and the arm. On the second layer, control and data
    acquisition can be done either by commercial or by home made
    cards, including one based on a Motorola 68HC12 fuzzy chip. Low
    level control may be implemented by fuzzy rules either on the
    fuzzy HW, or on the PC. The third layer consists of behavioral
    and data interpretation modules, implemented in the ETHNOS [<A
    HREF="art.html#PiaggioZaccaria98">12</A>,<A HREF="art.html#PiaggioetAl:99">11</A>]
    real time architecture.</FONT></P>

     FACE="Verdana">Goal keepers</FONT></H1>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the ART team we have developed
    two different kinds of goal keepers, TinoZoff which is described
    below, and Saracinescu, that was used during 1998 championship
    [<A HREF="art.html#Cassinis99">5</A>], but was not available
    for RoboCup-99.</FONT></P>

    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00031000000000000000"></A><FONT SIZE="+1"
     FACE="Verdana">Tinozoff</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The physical layout of the
    goalie is considerably different from the other players' structure.
    This goalie has a vision system based on two wide-angle cameras
    placed on top of it, having an aperture angle of about 70<SUP><I>o</I></SUP>
    vertically and 110<SUP><I>o</I></SUP> horizontally. This allows
    the robot to extend its field of view to over 200<SUP><I>o</I></SUP>,
    considering that the fields of view of the two cameras overlap
    by about 20<SUP><I>o</I></SUP> in the central region right in
    front of the goalie.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">As for its cinematics, the
    two driving wheels are located in the middle of the chassis,
    one on the front and the other on the rear. This makes translational
    movements more precise and accidental turns less likely. Balance
    is ensured by a pair of spheres, on which the robot leans, that
    are positioned along an axis at 90<SUP><I>o</I></SUP> to the
    wheel axis, and passing through its center. Turning is possible
    because the two wheels can be operated independently. Just ahead
    of the front wheel is a pneumatic kick device, whose air hangs
    just above.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The vision system and the self-localization
    method developed for it are described in [<A HREF="art.html#AdornietAl:99">1</A>].</FONT></P>

     FACE="Verdana">Middlefield players</FONT></H1>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In the ART team we currently
    have three types of middelfield players.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000"></A><FONT SIZE="+1"
     FACE="Verdana">Ronaltino-Tottino</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Ronaltino-Tottino is a middlefield
    player developed on BaseART. Its essential features from the
    hardware viewpoint are: a specialized vision system with a camera
    rotating on 360<SUP><I>o</I></SUP>, a compass, and infrared sensors
    to enable the kicking when the ball is close to the kickers.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The control system of this
    player is designed on top of SAPHIRA, an environment developed
    to implement the robot control both in terms of actions, realized
    as programs in the Colbert language, and in terms of fuzzy behaviours,
    that are executed by a fuzzy controller. In [<A HREF="art.html#IocchiNardi99">7</A>]
    we discuss our experience in the design of the control system
    for this player based on fuzzy rules. To overcome some of the
    difficulties encountered in the programming of robot behaviors
    in the RoboCup scenario we have developed several tools to support
    the designer in the debugging and experimental activities.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We also implemented several
    self-localization methods relying on the vision-based recognition
    of the goals, on the information coming from the compass and
    on the vision-based analysis of the lines in the field [<A HREF="art.html#IocchiNardi99a">8</A>].
    We have compared them trying to identify the conditions under
    which each source of information for localizing the player is
    reliable.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000"></A><FONT SIZE="+1"
     FACE="Verdana">Rel&egrave;, Bart, Homer</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Rel&egrave;, Bart and Homer
    are middlefield players, developed on baseART, provided with
    different settings for the kicking device and characterised by
    a novel software planning and control architecture based on the
    ETHNOS real-time programming environment. ETHNOS exploits the
    Linux RT multithreaded operating system and provides additional
    support from different points of view. From the communication
    perspective it supports and optimises transparent inter-robot
    information exchange and co-ordination across wireless media.
    From the runtime perspective it provides support for the real-time
    execution of periodic, sporadic and background tasks (called
    Experts), schedulability analysis, event handling, and resource
    allocation and synchronisation. From the software engineering
    perspective it provides support for rapid development, platform
    independence and software integration and re-use.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The whole set of software module
    for controlling the players has been developed over the ETHNOS'
    Kernel. Besides its use for managing communication with Pioneer
    hardware facilities, ETHNOS' Kernel has been used for developing
    several basic behaviors (Ball-Searching, Ball-Reaching, Ball-Shooting,
    Ball-Bringing) as well as the vision module. ETHNOS' Kernel has
    been selected because of the flexibility of its architecture,
    allowing the real time scheduling of both occasional Experts,
    that are conditionally activated, and periodic Experts. Thus,
    Vision Experts, and Map Building Experts are realized as Periodic
    Experts, whereas an arbitration module over basic robot skills
    can usefully exploit the fast real time decision making capabilities
    of a suitable Occasional Experts.</FONT></P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>

    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000"></A><FONT SIZE="+1"
     FACE="Verdana">Rullit</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Rullit is implemented on a
    <I>Mo</I><SUP>2</SUP><I>Ro</I> base. Its design is centered around
    the omnidirectional vision sensor we have implemented for RoboCup.
    It consists of a mirror studied to exploit at best all the camera
    definition both in the neighborough of the robot and at a large
    distance: the ball corresponds to a reasonable number of pixels
    from 10 to 400 cm all around the robot. The vision system is
    implemented mimicking some natural mechanisms for fast tracking
    and color interpretation: we have distances from all the visible,
    classified objects at a rate higher than 20 frames/sec. This
    makes it possible to implement behaviors and strategies that
    take advantage of the knowledge about most of what surrounds
    the robot. For instance, it can move without problems also backward
    at a high speed, or it can take a position while monitoring ball
    and other robots also not in front of it. A self-localization
    module also has enough reliable information to provide an approximate,
    but satisfactory extimation of the position in most of the situations.
    Behavior modules are implemented to face the different situations,
    including those produced by the current rules about charging.
    A fuzzy low-level control system provides reliable actuation
    to the fuzzy behaviors modules.</FONT></P>

     FACE="Verdana">ART Research perspective</FONT></H1>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Research is a major goal of
    all the members of the ART team. This is demonstrated by the
    specific contributions presented at the RoboCup Workshop [<A
    HREF="art.html#AmorosoetAl:99">2</A>,<A HREF="art.html#Bonarini99">4</A>,<A
    HREF="art.html#IocchiNardi99a">8</A>,<A HREF="art.html#PiaggioetAl:99">11</A>].
    It is worth emphasizing that the need of coordinating heterogeneous
    soccer players has lead to interesting results, by practically
    showing the feasibility of coordination in a fully distributed,
    heterogeneous multi-robot scenario. In the following we report
    on the research perspective of each group in the team.</FONT></P>

    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000"></A><FONT SIZE="+1"
     FACE="Verdana">Univ. Genova</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The research in the software
    control architecture carried out in ART has different goals which
    are tightly tied together: (1) the study and development of a
    hybrid cognitive model suitable for a set of interacting autonomous
    robots, (2) the analysis of the architectural and computational
    requirements of an autonomous robot, (3) the development of a
    suitable programming environment for multi robot applications.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">From the cognitive model perspective
    we aim to better understand the relationship between different
    forms of representation and reasoning starting from a reference
    model we recently proposed [<A HREF="art.html#Piaggio98">10</A>].
    In this model symbolic, diagrammatic and procedural representations
    and/or activities are integrated in a non-hierarchical framework.
    Different hierarchies are formed dynamically depending on the
    task that the robot has to perform. For example for a complex
    assembly operation symbolic representation and planning will
    drive the activity of motion control reactive procedures; for
    autonomous navigation tasks, diagrammatic and procedural knowledge
    will drive the robot behavior while the symbolic activities are
    only responsible of data interpretation and symbol extraction.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">From the software architecture
    perspective we intend to study what support is required and suitable
    to allow the robot to respond in real time to the changes in
    a partially structured environment. In particular our research
    will focus on scheduling algorithms that take into account the
    heterogeneity of the set of tasks that have to be executed: periodic/sporadic,
    hard real time/soft real time/any time/background, predictable/non
    predictable, etc. These algorithms will be integrated and experimented
    on using the ETHNOS [<A HREF="art.html#PiaggioZaccaria98">12</A>]
    programming environment.</FONT></P>

     FACE="Verdana">Politecnico Milano</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Our aim was to implement a
    reliable machine where the competences present in our Lab, and
    in the whole team, could merge to realize a large set of tasks,
    including RoboCup. We have faced all the problems related with
    the development of such a machine: hardware (both electronical
    and mechanical), operating system, sensors (including vision),
    low-level fuzzy control, behaviors, strategy, communication,
    and learning. Most of this activity up to now was aimed at building
    a robust base to experiment the higher level aspects. We have
    implemented our behaviors as modules activated by two sets of
    fuzzy preconditions: the <EM>cando preconditions</EM> enable
    the behavior, and the <EM>want preconditions</EM> give the amount
    of motivation for it. Moreover, we have two parameters: the static
    and the dynamic <EM>relevance</EM>. The first implements a priori
    a partial ordering among behaviors, the second a partial ordering
    modified according to the situation, and used to implement strategies.
    The behavior with the highest <EM>triggering level</EM> (a composition
    of these four factors), is activated, and its actions done. We
    have a winner-take-all activation, instead of a composition of
    proposed actions typical of fuzzy systems, since this gives more
    coherence to behavior selection. We have also implemented a reinforcement
    learning system that interprets the model built from the sensorial
    input, and identifies and classifies the actions taken by the
    other robots. By acting on the dynamic relevance, this system
    learns the best behavior for each situation, and makes Rullit
    to adapt its behavior to the opponents.</FONT></P>

     FACE="Verdana">Univ. Padova</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Coordinating the whole soccer-robot
    team is a fundamental problem in the multi-robot research field.
    A sound arbitration mechanism, for both single and collective
    actions, is the base for an appropriate coordinated performance
    of behavior-based autonomous systems. To approach correctly the
    problem of controlling a multi-robot system, we have also to
    consider the interference among robots as a potential to inhibit,
    or limit, the behavior of each single robot in the case of resource
    competition. This potential increases with the number of robots,
    eventually causing the degeneration of global performance, and
    forcing the use of social rules. In the soccer robot case, a
    further difficulty arises, due to the simultaneous presence of
    several playing agents in the same environment. Coordination
    among robots may arise when single individuals plan complementary
    actions, and when some kind of prediction is available.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">A second problem is given by
    the possibility of using a different kind of cooperation among
    robots, namely the implicit one. While passing intentional information
    is realized sending voluntarily explicit coordination messages
    to the other agents, implicit cooperation is realized by looking
    at the external behavior of the other agents, without any transmission
    of information. We have considered, the case where a set of actions,
    performed by a single robot to achieve its own goal, affects
    the world and helps other robots to achieve their goal. As the
    form of communication, we considered only the observing of the
    behavior of other robots, that is based on affecting the environment
    rather than on passing explicit messages. Thus, an interesting
    example of emergent cooperative behavior arises from this form
    of communication [<A HREF="art.html#Pagello1999">9</A>].</FONT></P>

     FACE="Verdana">Univ. Palermo</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The main contribution of the
    unit of Palermo is the development of a system for the robust
    segmentation of the color images acquired by the camera of the
    ART robot.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Although the colors of the
    objects in the RoboCup framework are clear and well defined,
    several disturbing conditions arise during the competitions.
    The light conditions of the field vary during the day; the persons
    and the other robots generate unexpected shadows effects; Different
    game fields may be characterized by similar but not equal colors.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">We are investigating a novel
    method based on feed-forward neural networks that learn to recognize
    the hue range of meaningful objects. A neural network does not
    require the exact knowledge of the statistical distribution of
    input items, as it generates an internal representation of input
    data distribution by a suitable learning phase.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">First experimental results
    showed that the approach is effective and robust with respect
    to environmental conditions, shadows and illumination variations.
    Although this method is tailored to the RoboCup experimental
    framework, we claim that it is an effective intermediate-level
    step in generic image interpretation tasks where the color is
    a meaningful descriptor.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">In designing the goalie, three
    main problems had to be tackled: (1) Object detection and motion
    estimation; (2) Self-localization and repositioning; (3) Task
    planning.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Object detection is performed
    through a color-based segmentation algorithm. Such an algorithm
    returns the position of the ball and of possible other players
    occupying the goalie's field of view for each frame received
    from the cameras. By comparing two subsequent frames and taking
    the robot motion into account, it is possible to estimate the
    instantaneous speed and direction of the ball. As it is not possible
    to acquire the images coming from the two frame grabbers at the
    same time, there is a switching strategy based on the detection
    of the ball. When the ball is not detected by either of the two
    cameras, the camera from which the image is acquired is switched.
    When the ball is detected by one of the two cameras the image
    is acquired from such a camera until it enters the overlap region
    of the two fields of view. At that point a switch to the other
    camera is performed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Self-localization and re-positioning
    are based on an algorithm which detects the lines of the penalty
    area and infers the goalie's position through a comparison between
    the images acquired by the two cameras. The goalie's area front
    line is first detected in the two frames. If the goalie is aligned
    with such a line, the two resulting images are symmetric. If
    the goalie is rotated, such a symmetry is lost.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">The main focus of the reasearch
    of the group at DIS, ``La Sapienza'' is on the design of cognitive
    mobile robots, namely robots where a deliberative layer including
    an explicit representation of the robot's knowledge on the environment
    is added, with the aim of increasing the robot's performance
    in accomplishing complex tasks. Our approach to the design of
    cognitive mobile robots insists on the view that a global design
    of the layers of the architecture is necessary to achieve the
    desired performance.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Consequently, we have developed
    both a set of basic behaviours to provide the robots with individual
    skill and we are currently working at identifying the behaviour
    structures that have to be executed in order to achieve a given
    goal in a given situation. Such structures embody concurrent
    actions, sensing actions and take into account of the cooperation
    among players.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">To this end we are extending
    the framework proposed in [<A HREF="art.html#DINR99">6</A>] so
