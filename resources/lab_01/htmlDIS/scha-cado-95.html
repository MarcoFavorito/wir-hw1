Problems in logic are well-known to be hard to solve in the worst case. Two
different strategies for dealing with this aspect are known from the literature:
language restriction and theory approximation. In this paper we are concerned
with the second strategy. Our main goal is to define a semantically
well-founded logic for approximate reasoning, which is justifiable from the
intuitive point of view, and to provide fast algorithms for dealing with it even
when using expressive languages. We also want our logic to be useful to
perform approximate reasoning in different contexts. We define a method for
the approximation of decision reasoning problems based on multivalued logics.
Our work expands and generalizes in several directions ideas presented by
other researchers. The major features of our technique are:

   o  approximate answers give semantically clear information about the
      problem at hand;

   o  approximate answers are easier to compute than answers to the original
      problem;

   o  approximate answers can be improved, and eventually they converge to
      the right answer;



   o  both sound approximations and complete ones are described.

The method we propose is flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of
reasoning problems. In our research we considered approximation of several
decidable problems with different worst-case complexity, involving both
propositional and first-order languages. In particular we defined approximation
techniques for: propositional logic, fragments of first order logic (concept
description languages) and modal logic. In our research we also addressed the
issue of representing the knowledge of a reasoner with limited resources and
how to use such a knowledge for approximate reasoning purposes.
