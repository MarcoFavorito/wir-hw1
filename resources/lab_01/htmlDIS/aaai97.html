<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>We study the computational properties of the propositional fragment
of MBNF, the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure introduced
by Lifschitz, which can be considered as a unifying framework for several
nonmonotonic formalisms, including default logic, autoepistemic logic,
circumscription, epistemic queries and logic programming. We characterize
the complexity and provide algorithms for reasoning in propositional MBNF.
In particular, we show that skeptical entailment in propositional MBNF
is $\Pi^p_3$-complete, hence, it is harder than reasoning in all the above
mentioned propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning. We also
prove the exact correspondence between negation as failure in MBNF and
negative introspection in Moore's autoepistemic logic. </P>
