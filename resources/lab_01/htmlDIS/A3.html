  In this paper we present SAX, a system that generates hypertext
  descriptions of conceptual models designed with the SADT methodology.
  The combination of natural language and hypertext significantly lowers the
  communicative barrier between the analyst and the domain expert, thus
  increasing the effectiveness of conceptual model validation. The application
  of hybrid techniques for text generation guarantees an optimal trade-off
  between robustness and portability across domains on one side and text
  fluency on the other.
