We call verification the process of finding the actual
explanation of a given set of manifestations.   We consider an
abductive setting, in which explanations are sets of assumptions.
To filter out erroneous explanations, a verification program
should propose which assumptions to check.   Given the abductive
setting of manifestations, assumptions, and a theory relating
them, we study the complexity of providing a minimal set of
assumptions to be checked in order to identify the actual
explanation.   We study also the case in which assumptions to be
checked are given in a tree-like order.
