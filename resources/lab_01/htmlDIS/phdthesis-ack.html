He was friendly and kind, as usual. He wrote down a   quick note on a small piece of paper about a cool open problem in dynamic transitive   closure. This problem is now a main topic of this dissertation. Since then,   he constantly helped me develop as a person and computer scientist. Actually,   I regard meeting Pino as one of the most important events in my life. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I'm even more grateful   to Giorgio Ausiello, who introduced me to Pino, and who was a tremendous source   of support and encouragement throughout these years. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A special thank   goes also to Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela, for his constant friendly support   and for always keeping his door open. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I thank all the   people at the Department of Computer and Systems Science of the University of   Rome &quot;La Sapienza&quot;. In particular, I am grateful to Roberto Baldoni,   Marco Cadoli and Marco Temperini for many useful discussions and to everyone   in the Algorithm Engineering Group for providing a warm and friendly working   environment. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I wish to thank   my roommate Francesco Quaglia for being a true friend and an extraordinary source   of advice, and for helping me realise the importance of a soun working method   in doing research. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everybody who knows   Daniele Frigioni can figure out how funny and pleasant it has been to have him   as a coauthor and friend. The results presented in this dissertation arose from   joint works with Alberto, Daniele, Pino and Umberto [1,2].</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I feel fortunate   to have had the opportunity for fruitful cooperation with the graph drawing   people at the University of Roma Tre. In particular, I thank Giuseppe Di Battista,   Walter Didimo, Giuseppe Liotta, Maurizio &quot;Titto&quot; Patrignani and Maurizio   Pizzonia. I also owe a lot to Pierluigi Crescenzi and Rossella Petreschi for   their valuable support and for encouraging me so many times. The results achieved   with them appeared in [3,4,5,6} and are not reported in this thesis. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I thank Giorgio   for being Coordinator of the PhD program and for serving with Rossella and Umberto   on my dissertation committee. A special mention goes to Valerie King and Christos   Zaroliagis, my external reviewers, for their extremely thorough examination   of my thesis and for their many constructive suggestions. In particular, I thank   Valerie for her previous great work in dynamic transitive closure: without her   results, I would have never come up with most of the original contributions   in my thesis. I am also grateful to Mikkel Thorup for many enlightening discussions.   </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am glad to mention   the European IST Programme ALCOM-FT and the project &quot;Algorithms for Large   Data Sets: Science and Engineering&quot; of the Italian Ministry for Scientific   Research which allowed me to travel and to attend conferences. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I thank Radu Aldulescu   and Albert Guttman for their invaluable performance of Cello Sonatas op. 5 nr.   1 in F major and op. 5 nr. 2 in G minor by Ludwig van Beethoven: their music   has been a magical source of inspiration during the preparation of this dissertation.   </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It would be a long   list to mention all the other friends I am indebted to. I gratefully thank all   of them. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My parents Mihaela   and Paul and my brother Emanuel deserve a warm and special acknowledgement for   their love and care. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Irene is certainly   the main contributor of all the best in my life, including this thesis. I thank   God for the extraordinary chance of having her as wife, friend, companion, and   even coauthor [7,8,9]. </font> </p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><font color="#333333" size="2">References.</font></b></font></p><p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[1] C.
