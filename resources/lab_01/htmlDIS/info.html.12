If you are in <em>Via    Cavour</em> (at the underground station) you can climb the stairs to San Pietro in    Vincoli.</font></li></ul><ul>  <li><font size="3"><strong>By car: </strong>it's the worst way to get to the School of    Engineering: it's very difficult to park and the fines are very expensive.</font></li></ul><ul>  <li><font size="3"><strong>By bus &amp; trolley: </strong>many buses stop near the faculty,    both on <em>Via Cavour</em> (number 75) and by the <em>Coliseum</em> (numbers 81, 85 and    87). By trolley, you can take the number 30/ which stops near the <em>Coliseum</em>.</font></li></ul><ul>  <li><font size="3"><strong>By underground: </strong>two underground stations on the B line    can be used: the Cavour station, on via Cavour at the foot of the Esquilino Hill and the    Colosseo station.</font></li></ul><ul>  <li><font size="3"><strong>From the airport (by taxi): </strong>taxi cost from/to the    airport to/from the center of Rome is the one indicated by the meter (in the range    45000-60000 Lit) plus the following extras:</font></li></ul><blockquote>  <ol style="font-family: Arial">    <li><font size="3">extra for the trip from the airport to Rome: 10000 Lit;</font></li>    <li><font size="3">extra for the trip from Rome to the airport: 14000 Lit;</font></li>    <li><font size="3">extra for baggage: 2000 Lit;</font></li>    <li><font size="3">extra for holiday trips: 2000 Lit;</font></li>    <li><font size="3">extra for night trips: 5000 Lit. A taxi trip from/to the airport to/from      the center of Rome is likely to take about 50 minutes and should never exceed 90 minutes      during peak traffic hours (around 7:30-9:30 and 17:30-19:30). </font></li>  </ol></blockquote><blockquote>  <p><font size="3">Authorized taxi cabs are yellow or white; the meter must show the fee  (except of extras). Tips are up to you: they are not mandatory.<br>  </font></p></blockquote><ul>  <li><font size="3"><strong>From the airport (by train):</strong> you can also take a train    either to &quot;Stazione Termini&quot; (Rome central station) or to &quot;Stazione    Ostiense&quot;. There is a train every hour to Termini station and a train every 20    minutes reaching all the following stations: Trastevere, Ostiense, Tiburtina. The regular    train service starts at 6 am and stops at 10 pm. </font></li></ul><blockquote>  <p><font size="3">The trains to Termini station take about half an hour to get there. The  ticket costs 10000 Lit. Once at Termini station you can either take a taxi to your hotel  or go for a walk (hotel area is at about 20 minutes walk from the Termini station, just  going down Via Cavour, on some 50 meters ahead of the Termini station hall on the left) or  you can take the metro line B for just one stop towards Laurentina (the metro stop you  must get off at is Cavour).</font></p>  <p><font size="3">The trains to the other three stations take between 25 and 40 minutes,  depending on the station you choose (Trastevere is the nearest one, Tiburtina the furthest  one). The train cost is 7000 Lit. Taxies are more likely found at Trastevere, while  underground connections to line B are available at Ostiense and Tiburtina (no underground  is available at Trastevere). If you take the metro from Ostiense, you must travel in the  direction Rebibbia; if instead you start from Tiburtina, you have to take the direction  Laurentina. In either case, the stop you have to get off at is Cavour. The underground  connection is easier at Tiburtina station than at Ostiense.</font></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><font size="4" color="#0000AF"><strong>Map of the area</strong></font></p><p><img src="images/mappa.gif" alt="mappa.gif (170920 bytes)" WIDTH="672" HEIGHT="598"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><h3><img src="images/back.gif" alt="Back to Home" align="center" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" border="0"></a> <strong> <a href="index.html">Back to the LabRobHome Page</a></strong></h3>
