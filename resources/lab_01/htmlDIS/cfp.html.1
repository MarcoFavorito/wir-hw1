<h2><i>Call for Papers</i></h2>

We invite submissions of technical papers of 8 pages and short
position papers (for people that want to participate in the
workshop without giving talks). Authors of accepted technical and
position papers will be invited to participate in the workshop
(participation will be by invitation only). 

<p>Accepted technical papers will be included in the proceedings. 
<!-- as normal papers (8 pages) or long papers (12 pages).-->
The workshop proceedings will be distributed in paper form at the
workshop, and will be made available electronically in the
<a href="http://CEUR-WS.org/">CEUR Workshop Proceedings</a> series.<br>

<h2><i>Scope</i></h2>

We invite contributions on all aspects of Description Logics.
Possible subjects include:

<ul>
<li>Foundations of Description Logics, including distinguishing
features of Description Logics with respect to other formalisms,
expressive power of Description Logics, decidability and complexity
of reasoning, and novel inference problems and reasoning techniques
for solving these problems.</li>

<li>Extensions of Description Logics, including, but not limited
to, closed world reasoning, defaults, epistemic reasoning, temporal
and spatial reasoning, procedural knowledge, and query
languages.</li>

<li>Integration of Description Logics with other formalisms, such
as object-oriented languages, constraint-based programming, logic
programming, and rule-based systems.</li>

<li>Use of Description Logics in applications or areas such as
natural language, planning, learning, databases, document
management, semistructured data, ontology design, ontology
languages, ontology engineering, semantic web, and grid
computing.</li>

<li>Building systems based on Description Logics, with special
emphasis on optimization and implementation techniques.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><i>Submission</i></h2>

Interested parties are invited to submit 
<ul>
<li>a technical paper not exceeding 8 pages <b>or</b></li>
<li>a short position paper indicating interest in Description Logics and the
    workshop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both kinds of submission should be formatted similar to previous Description
Logics workshops, following this <a href="submission/submission.tex">example
LaTeX file</a>. You can also view compiled
<a href="submission/submission.ps">postscript</a> and
<a href="submission/submission.pdf">PDF</a>
versions of this example file, which contains some more explanations concerning
the requested style. <i>Please avoid headers, footers, and page
numbering</i>.</p>

The use of LaTeX is encouraged but not mandatory.  If for some reason LaTeX
cannot be used, print out the <a href="submission/submission.ps">postscript</a>
or <a href="submission/submission.pdf">PDF</a> version of the example
submission and produce by any means a postscript or PDF file with the same
margins and possibly the same layout for sections and bibliography.  A
Microsoft Word style file is <i>not</i> available.

<p>Submissions should be sent by electronic mail as standard postscript or PDF
attachments to</p>

<center><a href="mailto:dl03@dis.uniroma1.it">dl03@dis.uniroma1.it</a></center>

<p>and must arrive before June 1, 2003. If you have any difficulties with the
requested document format (e.g., because you do not use LaTeX or cannot
generate postscript or PDF files), do not hesitate to contact the workshop
organizers at
<a href="mailto:dl03@dis.uniroma1.it">dl03@dis.uniroma1.it</a></p>

<p>Please include in the email (in plain text) the title,
author(s), contact name/email, and a short abstract of the paper,
e.g.:</p>

<td>Abstract:</td>
<td>A knowledge representation system provides an important service
to the rest of a knowledge-based system: it computes automatically
a set of inferences over the beliefs encoded within it. Given that
the knowledge-based system relies on these inferences in the midst
of its operation (i.e., its diagnosis, planning, or whatever),
their computational tractability is an important concern. Here we
present evidence as to how the cost of computing one kind of
inference is directly related to the expressiveness of the
representation language. As it turns out, this cost is perilously
sensitive to small changes in the representation language. Even a
seemingly simple frame-based description language can pose
intractable computational obstacles.</td>
