Traditionally, the core of a Terminological Knowledge Representation System
(TKRS) consists of a TBox or terminology, where concepts are introduced,
and an ABox or world description, where facts about individuals are stated in
terms of concept memberships. This design has a drawback because in most
applications the TBox has to meet two functions at a time: On the one



hand_similarly to a database schema_frame-like structures with type
information are introduced through primitive concepts and primitive roles; on
the other hand, views on the objects in the knowledge base are provided
through defined concepts. We propose to account for this conceptual
separation by partitioning the TBox into two components for primitive and
defined concepts, which we call the schema and the view part. We envision the
two parts to differ with respect to the language for concepts, the statements
allowed, and the semantics. We argue that this separation achieves more
conceptual clarity about the role of primitive and defined concepts and the
semantics of terminological cycles. Two case studies show the computational
benefits to be gained from the refined architecture.
