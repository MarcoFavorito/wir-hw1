                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>One of the main
                   themes in the area of Terminological Reasoning has been to identify  description  logics  (DLs)  that  are  both  very  properties  of
                   classes in terms of binary relations, and establishing several interdependencies among classes. One of the main themes in the area
                   of DLs has been to identify DLs that are both very expressive and
                   decidable. This issue can be profitably addressed by relying on
                   a correspondence between DLs and propositional dynamic logics  (PDLs).  In  this  paper,  we  exploit  the  correspondence  as  a
                   framework to investigate the decidability and the complexity of
                   a powerful DL, in which functional restrictions on both atomic
                   roles and their inverse are expressible. We then show that such
                   DL is suitable to represent n-ary relations, as needed in the applications of class-based formalisms to databases. The PDL that
                   we  use  in  this  work  is  a  proper  extension  of  Converse  Deterministic PDL, and its decidability and complexity is established
                   contextually.<p>
