We present a hybrid system for knowledge representation, called AL  -log, based
on the concept language ALC   and the deductive database language Datalog.
AL -log embodies two subsystems, called structural and relational. The former
allows for the definition of structural knowledge about the classes of interest
and the membership relation between objects and classes. The latter allows
for the definition of relational knowledge about the objects described in the
structural component. The interaction b between the two components is
obtained by allowing ALC  -constraints within Datalog clauses, thus requiring
the variables in the clauses to range over the set of instances of a specified
concept. We propose a method for hybrid reasoning based on constrained
resolution, where the usual deduction procedure defined for Datalog is
integrated with a method for reasoning on the structural knowledge.
