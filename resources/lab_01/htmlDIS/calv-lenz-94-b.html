Current object-oriented data models lack several important features that
would allow one to express relevant knowledge about the classes of a schema.
In particular, there is no data model supporting simultaneously the inverse of
the functions represented by attributes, the union, the intersection and the
complement of classes, the possibility of using nonbinary relations, and the
possibility of expressing cardinality constraints on attributes and relations. In
this paper we define a new data model, called CAR, which extends the basic
core of current object-oriented data models with all the above mentioned
features. A technique is then presented both for checking the consistency of
class definitions, and for computing the logical consequences of the knowledge
represented in the schema. Finally, the inherent complexity of reasoning in
CAR is investigated, and the complexity of our inferencing technique is
studied, depending on various assumptions on the schema.
