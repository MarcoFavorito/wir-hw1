The type data base is the part of the data base in which all the information
about classes, membrship relationships between objects and classes, and
interdependencies among classes are collected. We study specific type data
bases, which allow for representing different kinds of incomplete information,
such as existential and disjunctive assertions. In particular, we address the
problem of consistency checking and query answering, proposing efficient
solutions for both of them. Our analysis is carried out in the context of the
logical approach to data bases and knowledge representation, which provides a
suitable formal basis for the treatment of incomplete information.
