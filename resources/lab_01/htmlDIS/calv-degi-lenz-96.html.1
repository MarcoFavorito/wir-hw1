In this paper, we address the issue of representing and reasoning about
documents for which an explicit structure is provided. Specifically, we devise a
framework where Document Type Definitions (DTDs) expressed in the
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) are formalized in an
expressive Description Logic equipped with sound, complete, and terminating
inference procedures. In this way, we provide a general reasoning mechanism
that enables various reasoning tasks on DTDs, including the verification of
typical forms of equivalences between DTDs, such as strong equivalence and
structural equivalence, as well as parametric versions of these equivalences.
Notably, this general reasoning mechanism allows for verifying structural
equivalence in worst case deterministic exponential time, in contrast to the
known algorithms which are double exponential. As a whole, the study in this
paper provides some of the fundamental building blocks for developing
articulated inference systems that support tasks involving the intelligent
navigation of large document databases such as the World Wide Web.
