  In this paper we present an architecture for choosing a flexible response in a
  natural language system involved in information-seeking tasks. Our work
  considers the crucial issue of choosing what information to provide and how
  to structure it, considering from the generation perspective a model of
  dialogue that was previously developed to study the recognition activity of
  an agent. In such a model the underlying reasoning activity of an agent is
  represented by means of problem-solving plans, that manage domain and
  linguistic actions. The correct choice of the information to provide depends
  on the ability to select the action that best suits the domain situation and
  an answer that conveys the information in a way appropriate to the user.
  For this reason we provide heuristic evaluation criteria that consider both
  participants' goals and some other context- related factors impacting on the
  evaluation of the action to allow the problem-solving plans to make a choice
  among the available alternatives. Furthermore, we discuss how to convey the
  raw material in a suitable and understandable way by using different
  rhetorical relations. A detailed example illustrates how our approach models
  in a flexible way aspects of the interaction overlooked by previous systems.
