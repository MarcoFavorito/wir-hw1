<h1>Minimal Knowledge Approach to Reasoning about Actions and Sensing</h1>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p>
We present an autoepistemic approach for reasoning about actions in the
presence of incomplete information and sensing.  Specifically, we introduce
a logical formalism that combines a very expressive logic of programs, the
modal mu-calculus, with a minimal knowledge modality.  We show that
reasoning in such a formalism can be done by integrating model checking for
modal mu-calculus and propositional inference.  This allows for exploiting
existing model checking techniques and systems for sophisticated forms of
reasoning about actions, without renouncing to deal with incomplete
information about the dynamic system.
