The central aim of Algorithms Engineering is the study of the techniques
for the design of efficient algorithms and for the formal and experimental
analysis of their performance. Computer systems are becoming more and more
demanding in terms of performance, due to the increasing complexity of
both applications (that, for example, require the repeated solution of
large optimization problems on large sets of data), and computer systems
(that, for example, require a very efficient management of processors,
memories and interconnection networks). In the past twenty years, the theory
of algorithms has laid down the principles of algorithms design and of
complexity analysis of problems. Now, in order to approach the practical
solution of efficiency critical applications, many more aspects have to
be addressed, ranging from the study of realistic computation models, to
the definition of various types of algorithms that have to perform efficiently
in a dynamically changing environment, to the definition of new complexity
measures that allow to assess the practical usability of algorithms.

<P>Research work done in the area of Algorithms Engineering is report in
five subsections, the first three related to two large and very important
problem domains (Graph and combinatorial algorithms, Geometric computing
and Distributed and network algorithms) the last two devoted to two important
methods of processing information and solving problems in very complex
environments.

1.<T><A NAME="GRAPHS"></A>Graph and combinatorial algorithms</H3>
In this area the research has been focusing on dynamic graph algorithms,
dynamic hypergraph algorithms, and algorithmic techniques for several combinatorial
problems.

<P>In [<A HREF="#I2-C9">I2-C9</A>, <A HREF="#I2-R12">I2-R12</A>] the authors
propose a uniform approach to deal with incremental problems on digraphs,
and with decremental problems on dags. Using this approach the first incremental
and decremental solution for the dominator problem are given which are
more efficient than recomputing the solution from scratch after each update.

<P>Semi-dynamic algorithms are presented in [<A HREF="#I2-C12">I2-C12</A>]
for the single source shortest path problem on digraphs with positive real
edge weights, that are efficient in the output complexity model, and practical.
These results are extended in [<A HREF="#I2-R18">I2-R18</A>] to the fully
dynamic case.

<P>The problem of maintaining the transitive closure in a directed graph
under randomly chosen edge insertions and deletions is considered in [<A HREF="#I2-J3">I2-J3</A>].
The complexity bounds of updating and query operations outperform the corresponding
worst case off-line bounds.

<P>In [<A HREF="#I2-R16">I2-R16</A>] the authors propose the first semi-dynamic
solutions for the single source shortest path problem on digraphs with
integer edge weights, and for the breadth first search problem, which are
more efficient than recomputing the solution from scratch after each update,
taking O(n) amortized time per operation, where n is the number of nodes.
Along the same line of research, in [<A HREF="#I2-R17">I2-R17</A>] an incremental
algorithm is proposed to maintain a DFS-forest in a directed acyclic graph
under a sequence of arc insertions in O(n) amortized time per operation.
This compares favorably with the time required to recompute a DFS-forest
from scratch. This algorithm relies on an original characterization of
a DFS-forest in terms of a relaxed planar embedding of the graph.

<P>Algorithms for deciding properties of Petri nets that make use of a
hypergraph-based approach are presented in [<A HREF="#I2-R6">I2-R6</A>].
Namely the proposed algorithms allow to decide liveness and boundedness
of the net, and to dynamically maintains the set of potentially firable
transitions for conflict-free Petri nets and the wider classes of series-parallel-conflict-free
and series-parallel-nondeterministic-conflict-free Petri nets.

<P>Dynamic algorithms for the on-line maintenance of weighted hypergraphs
have been devised with application to satisfiability of propositional Horn
formulae with uncertainty in [<A HREF="#I2-R8">I2-R8</A>], where the authors
show how to represent a significant class of formulae by weighted directed
hypergraphs and present two algorithms that solve the on-line Horn-SAT
problem and find a minimum model for the formula working on the dynamic
weighted hypergraph representation. These algorithms make increasing assumptions
on the formula and the second one solves the on-line Horn-SAT problem with
a total time linear in the size of the formula, matching the optimal result
for Boolean Horn formulae.

<P>The complexity of bounded spherical orders (i.e. partial orders with
a single maximum and a single minimum whose diagram can be drawn on a sphere
with no edge crossings) is studied in [<A HREF="#I2-J6">I2-J6</A>], and
a tight bound of 4 for their Boolean dimension is given. In the case of
partial orders with more maximal or more minimal elements it is shown that
the Boolean dimension is never greater than 5. These results are obtained
by characterizing spherical orders in terms of containment between circular
arcs.
<H3>
2.<T><A NAME="GEOCOMP"></A>Geometric computing</H3>
The research on Geometric computing followed four main directions.

<P>One main task was the design, implementation and experimentation of
algorithms for computational geometry and graph drawing. In particular,
in [<A HREF="#I2-R25">I2-R25</A>, <A HREF="#I2-R23">I2-R23</A>] research
has focused on developing a methodology for designing robust algorithms
with low arithmetics demand. In [<A HREF="#I2-C4">I2-C4</A>, <A HREF="#I2-C5">I2-C5</A>]
activity has been devoted to developing a new architectural frame for visualization
of geometric algorithms over the world wide web. In [<A HREF="#I2-R5">I2-R5</A>]
a general scheme is presented for implementing persistency in C++. The
scheme is tailored to integrate heterogeneous multidimensional indexing
structures. In [<A HREF="#I2-C10">I2-C10</A>, <A HREF="#I2-R13">I2-R13</A>]
extensive experimentation has been carried out on graph drawing algorithms
that are frequently used in practical applications such as algorithms for
computing orthogonal representations and algorithms for computing directed
drawings. The problem of computing orthogonal representations with the
minimum number of bends is studied in [<A HREF="#I2-R14">I2-R14</A>].

<P>A second direction of research is about characterizing and computing
proximity drawings of graphs. Such family of drawings include minimum weight
triangulations, visibility representations, Gabriel drawings, rectangle
of influence and (-drawings as special cases. The results obtained combine
geometric graph theory and efficient algorithm design. The geometric constraints
that are taken into account by the algorithms include the clusterization
of groups of adjacent vertices in the drawing, and area minimization. The
area required by visibility representations and by Gabriel drawings is
studied in [<A HREF="#I2-R26">I2-R26</A>] and in [<A HREF="#I2-R19">I2-R19</A>].
Several classes of graphs that admit a rectangle of influence drawing are
characterized in [<A HREF="#I2-R24">I2-R24</A>]. Algorithms that compute
(-drawings for trees and outerplanar graphs are presented in [<A HREF="#I2-R11">I2-R11</A>,
<A HREF="#I2-C13">I2-C13</A>]. A new definition of proximity drawings is
introduced in [<A HREF="#I2-R15">I2-R15</A>]. A survey of proximity drawings
is in [<A HREF="#I2-J5">I2-J5</A>]. An algorithm that receives as input
a maximal outerplanar graph and computes as output a set of points whose
minimum weight triangulation is isomorphic to the input graph is presented
in [<A HREF="#I2-J7">I2-J7</A>].

<P>A third direction of research focused on the study of basic computational
geometry problems. The problem of computing a pair of axis-parallel rectangles
with minimum area that include a given set of polygonal objects is investigated
in [<A HREF="#I2-J4">I2-J4</A>]. Space and time optimal algorithms that
maintain a hive graph between two vertical sweep lines are given in [<A HREF="#I2-R3">I2-R3</A>].
In the same dynamic setting, in [<A HREF="#I2-R2">I2-R2</A>] it is shown
how to maintain the maximas of a set of 2d points in optimal space and
time.

<P>Finally a fourth direction of research applies computational geometry
techniques to data base applications. More specifically, in [<A HREF="#I2-R4">I2-R4</A>]
the concept of logical data partitioning in bitemporal databases is introduced,
where data are partitioned into blocks according to their temporal properties
and independently on the particular application. In this framework, basic
user update and query operations are considered, and it is shown how to
decompose them into lower level operations within single blocks. The approach
increases system efficiency, as substantiated by both theoretical and experimental
results.
<H3>
3.<T><A NAME="DISTRIB"></A>Distributed and network algorithms</H3>
In this area two research directions are being followed.

<P>Along the first direction theoretical aspects of distributed computation
have been studied, more specifically, distributed computation in totally
synchronous distributed network; this is a synchronous system for which
the symmetry breaking problem is unsolvable, and then it is not possible
to elect a leader and centralize the computation. In [<A HREF="#I2-J2">I2-J2</A>]
the problem of finding the extrema in a distributed multiset is considered,
consisting of determining the minimum and the maximum value of a multiset
whose elements are drawn from a totally ordered universe and stored at
the entity of a ring network. A novel extrema-finding algorithm is given
that improves the bit-time complexity of the previous known result.

<P>Along the second line, applicative problems have been considered. In
[<A HREF="#I2-R10">I2-R10</A>] the authors deal with the scheduling of
transmissions in TDMA packet radio networks. They show that the problem
of deciding the feasibility of a schedule is NP-complete, and propose heuristics
that are shown to be close to the optimal solution for randomly generated
instances of the problem.

<P>In [<A HREF="#I2-C11">I2-C11</A>] the problem of efficiently distributing
a mutual exclusive resource in a ring topology network using a token based
strategy is considered. The attention is focused on the number of messages
per request necessary to allocate the resource, providing a bounded delay
between the time at which the request is issued and the time at which the
resource is obtained. Two new algorithms are proposed and analyzed with
amortized complexity techniques.

<P>In [<A HREF="#I2-C8">I2-C8</A>] the authors propose broadcasting algorithms
for line digraphs in the telephone model. The new protocols use a broadcasting
protocol for a graph G to obtain a broadcasting protocol for the graph
LkG, the graph obtained by applying k times, the line digraph operation
to G. As a consequence improved bounds for the broadcasting time in De
Bruijn, Kautz and Wrapped Butterfly digraphs are obtained.
<H3>
4.<T><A NAME="COMPL"></A>Complexity and approximation</H3>
Due to their intrinsic complexity, for NP-hard optimization problems we
cannot hope to find efficient general solution algorithms and we need to
restrict ourselves to approximate solutions. Hence, the study of approximate
algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems has a considerable importance
both from the theoretical point of view and with respect to the practical
aim of designing efficient approximation algorithms which are guaranteed
to provide a solution within a maximum relative error. In this area two
research directions are being pursued.

<P>Along the first direction theoretical aspects of approximability have
been studied. In particular the class of problems that can be efficiently
approximated by means of local search algorithms has been studied and a
new and more powerful local search approximation techniques, that generalizes
the standard technique and enlarge the power of this general paradigm,
have been developed [<A HREF="#I2-J1">I2-J1</A>]. Besides, in [<A HREF="#I2-R1">I2-R1</A>]
APX-hardness results for several optimization problems on cubic and at-most-cubic
graphs that belong to MAX SNP, namely Minimum vertex cover, Maximum independent
set, Minimum dominating set and Maximum cut.

<P>Along the second line, approximation algorithms have been designed for
specific combinatorial problems. Namely, in [<A HREF="#I2-C1">I2-C1</A>]
the minimum independent dominating set problem in bounded degree graphs
has been studied, and approximate algorithms based on greedy and local
search techniques has been developed. Furthermore, in [<A HREF="#I2-R22">I2-R22</A>]
the authors propose the first approximation algorithms for the ancient
problem of minimizing the total flow time of a set of jobs on parallel
machines, for both the preemptive and the non-preemptive case, where the
flow time of a job is the difference between completion and release time,
and the total flow time is the sum of the flow times of all jobs. Each
job must be assigned after a given release time to a machine for a given
processing time. In the non-preemptive version, the processing of a job
once started cannot be interrupted. In the preemptive version the execution
of a job can be interrupted and resumed later on any machine. The algorithm
known as Shortest Remaining Processing Time is proved to have a logarithmic
approximation ratio for the preemptive case. For the non-preemptive case,
a general technique that turns a preemptive solution into a non preemptive
solution at the expenses of a O((n) factor is proposed. Unapproximability
results for the problem are also presented.
<H3>
5.<T><A NAME="ONLINE"></A>On-line algorithms</H3>
The research on On-line algorithms followed four main directions.

<P>A first direction of research is about telecommunication networks. The
on-line call admission control problem in optical networks is studied in
[<A HREF="#I2-C3">I2-C3</A>]. A sequence of communication requests between
two nodes of the network is presented one by one. A communication to be
accepted must be assigned with a wavelength and a path connecting the two
nodes. The goal is that of maximizing the number of communications accepted.
The paper studies several models of optical networks, depending upon the
nature of the network switches. The paper then presents randomized algorithms
with polylogarithmic competitive ratio for specific topologies both for
one direction and bidirectional communication.

<P>In [<A HREF="#I2-C6">I2-C6</A>] the authors study the performance of
on-line randomized algorithms for routing problems in networks. The paper
develops a technique for obtaining lower bounds on the competitive ratio
of randomized algorithms for a wide class of on-line graph optimization
problems: induced subgraph satisfying a hereditary property, edge-disjoint
paths, graph coloring, path coloring. Irrespective of the time complexity,
an ((n() lower bound on the competitive ratio of randomized on-line algorithms
is shown for any of these problems. These results are then applied to find
lower bounds for on-line virtual circuit and optical routing problems.

<P>On-line routing in WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) optical networks
is studied in [<A HREF="#I2-R9">I2-R9</A>]. A sequence of requests arrives
over time, each is a pair of nodes to be connected by a path. The problem
is to assign a wavelength and a path to each pair, so that no two paths
sharing a link are assigned the same wavelength, with the goal of minimizing
the number of wavelengths used to establish all connections. The paper
gives on-line algorithms with logarithmic competitive ratio for trees,
trees of rings and meshes topologies, and almost matching lower bounds.
The paper also considers the Space Division Multiplexing technology where
every edge is associated with parallel links. For arbitrary networks with
a logarithmic number of parallel links an on-line algorithm is presented
with logarithmic competitive ratio.

<P>A second direction of research focused on scheduling and routing problems.
A version of multiprocessor scheduling is considered in [<A HREF="#I2-C7">I2-C7</A>],
with the special feature that jobs may be rejected at a certain penalty.
In the on-line version the jobs arrive one by one and we have to schedule
or reject a job before we have any information about future jobs. The objective
is to minimize the makespan of the schedule for accepted jobs plus the
sum of the penalties of rejected jobs. The main result is a 1+(( 2.618
competitive algorithm for the on-line version of the problem, where ( is
the golden ratio. A matching lower bound is also provided.

<P>In [<A HREF="#I2-R7">I2-R7</A>] the authors deals with the problem of
efficiently serving a set of requests that are presented in an on-line
fashion in a metric space. A traveling salesman must update its route every
time a new request is communicated. The goal is that of minimizing the
time needed to serve all the presented requests. This work presents competitive
algorithms for the cases in which the metric space is arbitrary or the
real line.

<P>The problem of making capital investments in machines for manufacturing
a product is studied in [<A HREF="#I2-C2">I2-C2</A>]. Opportunities for
investment occur over time, every such option is associated with a capital
cost for a machine and a resulting productivity gain, i.e. a lower production
cost for one unit of product. The goal is that of minimizing the total
production and capital costs when future demand for the product being produced
and investment opportunities are unknown. Optimal logarithmically competitive
algorithms are proposed for the general case, while for a restricted version
constant competitive bounds are proved.

<P>A last task was the development of general techniques for the analysis
of on-line problems. In this setting, in [<A HREF="#I2-R20">I2-R20</A>]
a general technique is proposed to devise upper and lower bounds for on-line
resource management problems and show its applications to a number of routing
and scheduling problems.

<P>A general methodology based on linear programming to model a wide class
of on-line routing and scheduling problems is also presented in [<A HREF="#I2-R21">I2-R21</A>].
Efficient algorithms, whose logarithmic competitive ratio is logarithmic
is optimal up to a constant factor, are presented for the maximization
and the minimization version of the problem. This methodology finds applications
to virtual circuit routing, packet routing, multiprocessor scheduling and
shop-scheduling problems.
