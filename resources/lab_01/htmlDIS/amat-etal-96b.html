Modal logics characterized by a class of frames satisfying the insertion
property are shown to be suitable for Reiter's default logic. The canonical fix
point construction defined by Marek, Schwarz and Truszczynski for Reiter's
default logic is refined and a new paradigm for nonmonotonic logic is
addressed.Suitable modal logics for such a construction must contain KD4.
When reflexivity is added to the modal logic used for the fix point construction
then the Marek Schwarz and Truszczynski framework for Reiter's default logic
is obtained. The framework proposed is appropriate also when the family of



modal logics in between S4 and S4f are used. If, instead, reflexivity is
dropped, then a new family of modal logics is gained, namely the modal logics
in betweenKD4 and KD4Z. The upper bound can be extended to the modal
logic KD4LZ whenever the propositional language taken into account is finite.
