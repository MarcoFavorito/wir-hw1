  A new hybrid approach for autonomous agents is described. The approach
  integrates in a principled way the functional and the behavioral approaches
  of agent design. The integration is based on the introduction of a conceptual
  space representation that links the subsymbolic level, which is a repository
  of reactive modules, with the symbolic level, in which rich symbolic
  descriptions of the agent environment take place. Results are reported
  obtained by an experimental implementation of the agent.
