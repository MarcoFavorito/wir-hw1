<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
<br>
Ranking is an integral part of any information retrieval system.
In the case of the Web, because of its huge size, the frequency of Web
search, and the demanding nature of the Web users, ranking becomes even
more critical. In the recent years there has been a surge of research
activity in the area of Link Analysis Ranking, where the underlying
hypertext graph topology is used to rank web pages.  We consider some of
the previously published algorithms and we introduce some new
alternatives.<p>
 
One of our new algorithms is based on a Bayesian statistical approach as
opposed to the more common algebraic/graph theoretic approach. We also
examine the application of non-linear dynamical systems for ranking.
Although the mathematics for studying non-linear dynamical systems are not
as well understood, we prove that the dynamical system we define converges
for any initialization, and we study the combinatorial properties of the
stationary weights.<p>
 
We also define a formal framework for the theoretical analysis of Link
Analysis Ranking algorithms. Within this framework we formally define
various properties such as monotonicity, stability, and similarity. We
study the properties of existing algorithms, and we provide an axiomatic
characterization of the In-Degree algorithm that ranks each page according
to number of links that point to it.
