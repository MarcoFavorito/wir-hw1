<br>
We consider the general on-line two server problem in which at each step
both servers receive a request, which is a point in a metric space. One of
the servers has to be moved to its request. The special case where the
requests are points on the real line is known as the CNN-problem. It has
been a well-known open question if an algorithm with a constant competitive
ratio exists for this problem.  We answer this question in the affirmative
sense by providing an algorithm that is 23808-competitive on any metric
space.
The constant is huge and the algorithm is rather ugly but our main goal was
indeed to settle the question. We believe that our result gives new insight
in the problem and will lead to more and much better algorithms for the
general $k$-server problem in the near future.<p>
 
Joint work with Leen Stougie and Willem de Paepe.
