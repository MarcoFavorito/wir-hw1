Introduction</A>
</H3>

<P>
The Artificial Intelligence research group is mainly working in
Knowledge Representation, Planning, Search and Natural Language
Processing.

<P>
Knowledge Representation deals with languages, formalisms, and the
associated reasoning apparatus, including complexity of reasoning.
Within Knowledge Representation we are mainly concerned with the
following
topics: 

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The development of suitable formalisms to support various aspects
of reasoning and to combine different logics, which in the following
pages are collected under the title ``Commonsense reasoning''.
<P>
<DT>2.
<DD>The specification of formal languages for knowledge
representation,
which integrate different logics and formalisms, and exhibit suitable
computational properties. These topics are illustrated in the section on
``Description logics''.

<P>
<DT>3.
<DD>The investigation of languages for program, actions, and intentions
and, in general, languages to express modalities. Research done on these
languages is described in the section titled ``Modal and dynamic
logics''.

<P>
<DT>4.
<DD>The development of methodologies for access control and computer
security based on formal logics. This aspect is addressed in the section
``Access control and computer security''.

<P>
<DT>5.
<DD>The definition of methods and techniques for reasoning about
actions, and for the design and the realization of actual agents (in
particular 
mobile robots) that are able to accomplish complex tasks in real
environments. These topics are described in the section titled
``Cognitive robotics and reasoning about actions''.

<P>
<DT>6.
<DD>The study of computational properties of formalisms and languages,

</DL>

<P>
Research on description logics, actions, cognitive robotics, commonsense
reasoning and complexity led to the realization of tools and techniques
that support the specification and implementation of software for
controlling mobile robots.
 
The international recognition of the achievements in the field of
knowledge representation is highlighted by the choice of Prof. Luigia
Carlucci Aiello as conference chair of next IJCAI - International Joint
Conference on Artificial Intelligence, the main worldwide conference on
AI - to be held in Stockholm, 1999, and Maurizio Lenzerini as invited
speaker at the International Conference on the Principles of Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning (KR'98) that was held in Trento in June
1998. 

<P>
Research in other areas of AI, namely, Planning, Scheduling and Natural
Language Processing has been quite active in developing tools for
applications to real cases and prototypes. 

<P>
The planning research group has devised algorithms, heuristics and
suitable formalisms to realize flexible architectures for planning and
scheduling. This work is described in the section on ``Knowledge-based
architectures for planning and scheduling''.

<P>
Finally, the group working on ``Natural Language Processing'' has been
developing a prototype for knowledge-based text summarization.

Commonsense Reasoning</A>
</H3>

<P>
As a general issue
commonsense reasoning investigates the reasoning mechanisms
of an intelligent agent operating in realistic domains.
Research in commonsense reasoning develops
suitable formalisms to support various aspects
of reasoning, such as nonmonotonic reasoning, belief
revision, abduction, contextual reasoning etc.
Many formalisms, which also require  to combine several logics,
  have been devised in
the knowledge representation research community  to challenge
 limitations of classical formalisms.

<P>
The results obtained by our
research 
group  on commonsense reasoning  are described in the
following subsections.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00025210000000000000">
Belief Revision</A>
</H4>

<P>
Belief Revision is an area of commonsense reasoning involving
the problem of changing a knowledge base as a result of a contradictory
observation.
Arbitration is a form of belief revision. It is defined as a ``symmetric''
merging of two or more knowledge bases. In many scenarios, there are two or
more knowledge bases that represent the same domain.  The problem of
arbitration is to consistently merge all the information coming from different
sources. The paper [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_LIBER_J">11</A>] contains the definition of general
principles of arbitration, as well as a semantical representation of the
arbitration operators.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00025220000000000000">
Nonmonotonic reasoning and modal logic</A>
</H4>

<P>
The relationship between the notion of minimal knowledge and McDermott
and Doyle's nonmonotonic modal logics is analyzed in
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_ROSAT_J">13</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_ROSAT_R">85</A>],
which study the problem of embedding Halpern and Moses' modal logic of
minimal knowledge states into two families of modal formalisms for
nonmonotonic reasoning, McDermott and Doyle's nonmonotonic modal logics and
ground nonmonotonic modal logics.  It is shown that Halpern and Moses'
logic can be embedded into all ground logics: as a byproduct, the
translation thus defined allows for establishing a lower bound for the
problem of skeptical reasoning in all ground logics. Furthermore, a
translation of Halpern and Moses' logic into a significant subset of
McDermott and Doyle's formalisms is presented. Such a translation both
indicates the ability of Halpern and Moses' logic of expressing minimal
knowledge states in a more compact way than McDermott and Doyle's logics,
and allows for a comparison of the epistemological properties of such
nonmonotonic modal formalisms.

<P>
The epistemological properties of Lifschitz's logic of minimal knowledge
and negation as failure MKNF are investigated in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_ROSAT_A_C">47</A>]. In
particular, the paper presents a polynomial, non-faithful, modular
embedding of Lifschitz's logic MKNF into Halpern and Moses' logic of minimal
knowledge S5G. From the theoretical viewpoint, this result implies that
minimal knowledge has the same expressive power of negation as failure,
hence it is possible to embed all the best known propositional nonmonotonic
formalisms, in particular default logic, autoepistemic logic, and
circumscription, into S5G.  From the perspective of knowledge-based
systems, the proposed embedding allows in principle for realizing negation
as failure in systems without a negation as failure construct, as e.g. positive disjunctive deductive databases.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_ROSAT_B_C">48</A>] a study of the trade-off between the expressive 
abilities
and the complexity of reasoning in propositional nonmonotonic knowledge
bases is presented. First, the most popular forms of nonmonotonic
mechanisms used in knowledge representation are analyzed: in particular, it
is shown that epistemic queries and epistemic integrity constraints are
naturally expressed through the notion of negation as failure. Based on the
above analysis, the complexity of reasoning with different subsets of such
nonmonotonic constructs is studied. Such a complexity characterization
induces a complexity based classification of the various forms of
nonmonotonic reasoning considered: in particular, it is proven that
negation as failure is computationally harder than epistemic disjunction,
which apparently contradicts previous complexity results obtained in the
logic programming setting.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_ROSAT_D_C">50</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_ROSAT_C_C">49</A>] a unifying view of negation as failure, 
integrity
constraints, and epistemic queries in nonmonotonic reasoning is
presented. Specifically, the relationship between satisfiability and
logical implication in nonmonotonic logics is analyzed, showing that, in
many nonmonotonic formalisms, it is possible and easy to reduce logical
implication to satisfiability. This result not only allows for establishing
new complexity results for the satisfiability problem in nonmonotonic
logics, but also establishes a clear relationship between the studies on
epistemic queries and integrity constraints in monotonic knowledge bases
with the work on negation by default in nonmonotonic reasoning and logic
programming.  From the perspective of the design of knowledge
representation systems, such a reduction allows for defining both a simple
method for answering epistemic queries in knowledge bases with nonmonotonic
abilities, and a procedure for identifying integrity constraints in the
knowledge base, which can be employed for optimizing reasoning in such
systems.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_NARDI_B_C">45</A>] it is shown that the most well-known nonmonotonic
reasoning formalisms are actually characterized by two closure assumptions:
a minimal knowledge assumption and an autoepistemic assumption.  This
thesis is justified by introducing generalized default logic (GDL),
obtained through a simple and natural generalization of Reiter's default
logic, which fully captures both closure assumptions.  Then, the
relationship between GDL and nonmonotonic modal logics is analyzed, showing
the existence of a full correspondence between such modal formalisms and
GDL.  This correspondence provides a unified reading of nonmonotonic
reasoning formalisms in terms of the above two assumptions; in particular,
it clarifies the relationship between default and autoepistemic logic.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_AMATI_R">52</A>] different paradigms for formalizing the  notion of
nonmonotonic provability are  presented. It is  also shown
 that logics able to embed nonmonotonic inference
are those modal logics that allow for a context dependent form of reasoning
 requiring, in its turn,  context dependent proofs.

<P>
Among the various formalisms developed to deal with contextual reasoning,
McCarthy has proposed the logic of context with the <TT>ist</TT>(c,p) modality
as foundational formalism.
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_AMATI_C">15</A>] contextual reasoning is formalized using
multiple contexts and solving a  system of equation with parameters,
each standing for the context that has to be devised.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00025230000000000000">
Contextual reasoning</A>
</H4>
The need of an explicit modeling for the usage of reasoning resources by an
intelligent agent is tackled in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_WEYHR_J">14</A>]. In particular,
notions such as problems, solutions, and problem solving activities -which are
usually left implicit in the discussions of autonomous agents- are explicitly
described and a framework to reason about them is provided. This work describes
the architecture of a reasoner, who solves puzzles (built from a finite number
of components) and reasons about knowledge, by explicitly using the notion of
resource.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_SANGI_C">51</A>], contexts are applied to game theory: combinatorial
explosion, typical of war games, is avoided by means of contextual reasoning in
local contexts and global merging of results.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00025300000000000000">
Description Logics</A>
</H3>

<P>

<P>
The goal of this research is to study the foundations of a logical approach to
structured knowledge representation languages, with regard to both the
expressive power and the computational properties of the associated reasoning
techniques.  The definition of knowledge bases by means of structured knowledge
representation languages is done by specifying a terminological knowledge base
(TBox), where concepts are defined, along with an assertional knowledge base
(ABox), where facts about individuals are stated in terms of these concepts.
Expressive variants of description logics are studied
in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_D_R">57</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_E_R">58</A>].

<P>
The large amount of data available from the World Wide Web and the presence
of many different information sources require powerful and effective tools
for extracting and summarizing relevant information. In
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEROS_B_C">37</A>] techniques for automatic extraction of information
about a specific domain from Web sites are described.  Description Logics
are used as the data model representing the information sources and the
application domain. Moreover, the reasoning services of a DL-based system
(CLASSIC) have been used during the process of information extraction.
These techniques have been used within the WAG project in order to provide
the system with a tool for populating a data base by extracting data from
the Web [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CATAR_C">29</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEROS_A_C">36</A>].  The WAG system is described in
detail under the section WWW access in the chapter on Data Bases.

<P>
The possibility to profitably exploit expressive Description Logics and the
associated reasoning techniques for conceptual data modeling is demonstrated in
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_J">7</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_F_R">59</A>].

<P>
In recent years there has been a growing interest in accessing, relating, and
combining data from multiple sources.  Indeed, Information Integration is one
of the core problems in distributed databases, cooperative information systems,
and data warehousing, which are key areas in the software development industry.

<P>
Two critical factors for the design and maintenance of applications requiring
Information Integration are conceptual modeling of the domain, and reasoning
support over the conceptual representation.  In
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_E_C">24</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_F_C">25</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_G_C">26</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_B_R">55</A>] it is
demonstrated that Knowledge Representation and Reasoning techniques can play an
important role for both of these factors, by proposing a Description Logic
based framework for Information Integration.  It is shown that the development
of successful Information Integration solutions requires not only to resort to
very expressive Description Logics, but also to significantly extend them.  A
novel approach to conceptual modeling for Information Integration is presented,
which allows for suitably modeling the global concepts of the application, the
individual information sources, and the constraints among different sources.
Moreover, inference procedures for the fundamental reasoning services are
devised, namely relation and concept subsumption, and query containment under
the constraints expressed in the schema [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_B_C">21</A>].  Finally, a
methodological framework for Information Integration is presented, which can be
applied in several contexts, and highlights the role of reasoning services
within the design process.

<P>
The above framework for Information Integration is applied to the setting
of Data Warehousing in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_H_C">27</A>]. Moreover, [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_B_R">55</A>] 
reports
on an application of the methodology for Information Integration in the
context of Data Warehousing in Telecom Italia: such an activity has been
performed within the Esprit long term research project DWQ, ``Foundation of
Data Warehouse Quality''. A further extension of the integration
methodology, which takes into account data integration besides schema
integration, is presented in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_C_R">56</A>].

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_I_C">28</A>] it is shown that it is possible to eliminate inverse 
roles
and functional restrictions from knowledge bases expressed in the
description logic ALCFI, while preserving the soundness and
completeness of inference.  Specifically, a polynomial encoding from
ALCFI knowledge bases into ALC ones is presented, which
eliminates functional restrictions and inverse roles, adding enough
information so as not to destroy the meaning of concepts in the original
knowledge base with respect to the reasoning tasks.

<P>
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DONIN_A_J">8</A>] an integrated system for knowledge
representation, called AL-log, is presented. AL-log is based on description
logics and the deductive database language Datalog. AL-log embodies two
subsystems, called structural and relational.  The former allows for the
definition of structural knowledge about classes of interest (concepts) and
membership relation between objects and classes.  The latter allows for the
definition of relational knowledge about objects described in the
structural component. The interaction between the two components is
obtained by allowing constraints within Datalog clauses, thus requiring the
variables in the clauses to range over the set of instances of a specified
concept.  Moreover, a method for query answering in AL-log based on
constrained resolution is presented.

<P>
The addition of an epistemic modal operator to Description Logics is
addressed in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DONIN_B_J">9</A>]. It is shown that the
epistemic operator formalizes procedural rules, as provided in many
knowledge representation systems, and enables sophisticated query
formulation, including various forms of closed-world reasoning.  An
effective procedure for answering epistemic queries posed to a knowledge
base expressed in a description logic is presented. The computational
complexity of reasoning with the epistemic operator is also addressed,
identifying cases in which an appropriate use of the epistemic operator can
help in decreasing the complexity of reasoning.

<P>
The problem of modeling semi-structured data is important in many application
areas such as multimedia data management, biological databases, digital
libraries, and data integration.  The appropriateness of various knowledge
representation formalisms, and in particular of Description Logics, for
representing and reasoning about semi-structured data schemas and structured
(e.g., XML) documents is analyzed in
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_D_C">23</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_C_C">22</A>,<A

 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_G_R">60</A>,,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CALVA_I_R">62</A>].

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00025400000000000000">
Modal and Dynamic Logics</A>
</H3>

<P>
This research activity has focussed on the development of effective deductions
methods for dynamic and modal logics which have a number of important
applications in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Security. In particular
there has been a twofold focus on the development of efficient deduction
methods in the general case, the application of tableaux methods to problems of
computer security modeled with modal and dynamic logics.

<P>
On the first issue, the work [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_A_R">81</A>] tackles the development of
tableaux methods for a wide range of modal logic and compares the computational
characteristics of this method with other methods presented in the literature.
It also solves (positively) the problem of decidability for the modal logic of
positive introspection S4 and establish a number of bounds for the space and
time complexity of this and other deduction methods for modal logic. An advance
since the work of Pratt in 1982 has been the development of tableaux method and
algorithms directly for CPDL. A prefixed tableaux calculus for CPDL is devised
in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEGIA_F_R">74</A>], based on a combination of different techniques such
as prefixed tableaux for modal logics and model checkers for mu-calculus. The
calculus, which is naively worst-case NEXPTIME, is transformed into an EXPTIME
algorithm (recall that CPDL is EXPTIME-complete) but using careful techniques
which make full use also of failed computations. A further improvement has been
achieved in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_C_C">43</A>] with the introduction of the operation of
simplification which plays for tableaux the same role as subsumption for
resolution and unit for Davis-Putnam. This work also combines theoretical and
experimental results for random SAT and IFIP benchmarks.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00025500000000000000">
Access control and computer security</A>
</H3>

<P>
The development of tableaux methods for access control and computer security
has been tackled in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_J">12</A>]. These works present a prefixed tableaux
method for the calculus developed at the Digital System Resource Centre by
Abadi, Lampson et. al. for the formal verification of authentication and 
access
controls systems. Beside the applicative interest, the calculus poses
interesting technical challenges, since it has not the tree-model property,
introduces relations between modalities which cannot be compiled into axiom
schemata, and has some features of the universal modality.

<P>
Further research work in the application of automated reasoning techniques in
computer security has been carried in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MARRA_R">80</A>] where the
properties of the U.S. Data Encryption Standard has been encoded in
propositional logic and automated reasoning tool have been used for
cryptanalytic attacks. This direction of research have been further explored in
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_C_R">83</A>] where CSP techniques and local search have been also
applied.

Cognitive Robotics and Reasoning about Actions</A>
</H3>

<P>
Cognitive robotics [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEGIA_B_B">3</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEGIA_A_B">2</A>] is a very recent
research field that aims to design and realize actual agents (in particular
mobile robots) that are able to accomplish complex tasks in real environments
and that, to this purpose, can be controlled at a high level by providing them
with a description of the world and of the tasks to be performed. The cognitive
capabilities of the robot are provided by the deductive properties of a
logic-based formalism for reasoning about actions.
The research at DIS as been concerned with all aspects of Cognitive Robotics,
going from the actual realization of working robots (in relation with the
RoboCup) to investigations on formalisms for reasoning about actions.
Such research is illustrated below.

<P>
The RoboCup competition is an event conceived for comparing robotic
technologies in a common setting given by a soccer match between robotic teams.
We take advantage of this competition for setting up a team of robot soccer
players and for experimenting several techniques for mobile robots control and
navigation, image processing and vision, and for team coordination.
The participation in RoboCup 1998 of the Azzurra Robot Team (the Italian team
of robotic soccer players) is described in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_NARDI_A_C">44</A>].  A new
mobile platform for robotic soccer has been developed.  It includes sensor
devices for acquiring information about the objects in the field and acting
devices for moving the robot and kicking the ball.
Navigation tasks of the robots have been decomposed in small control units,
called behaviors.  [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_IOCCH_B_R">79</A>] describes our experience in
designing behaviors for mobile robots playing soccer, and a discussion, from a
user/programmer perspective, on their implementation by means of fuzzy
behaviors and of a robot programming language.
Furthermore, techniques for acquiring information about the environment have
been studied.  In particular, stereoscopic vision, that is a technique for
inferring the 3D position of objects from two or more simultaneous view of a
scene, has been proved to be a reliable and effective way to extract
information about distances of objects.  A real-time multiresolution stereo
vision system is described in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_IOCCH_C">38</A>]. It provides the robot with
real-time, accurate, and reliable range information about the environment.
Because of the complexity of the RoboCup environment and the tasks to be
accomplished, reasoning capabilities are essential. Indeed the main objective
of our research is the development of <EM>cognitive robotic soccer players</EM>.
To do this, studies on a mobile robot equipped with autonomous reasoning
capabilities (``Tino'' project) have been done
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_IOCCH_A_R">78</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEGIA_A_R">69</A>,<A

aiming at designing efficient forms of reasoning for reasoning about actions
and planning.

<P>
The Situation Calculus is the most used formalism for reasoning about actions
in Artificial Intelligence.  Its expressive richness allows the integration of
various aspects of dynamic systems in a unique formalism.  In cooperation with
people of Cognitive Robotics Group at the University of Toronto, several issues
related to the Situation Calculus have being investigated at DIS. In
particular:
axiomatic foundations of the situation calculus
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_PIRRI_R">84</A>,<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_LEVES_J">10</A>];
high-level (concurrent) robot programs
[<A

sensing and sensors[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEGIA_E_R">73</A>].
In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DELLA_R">53</A>] a simulation system for a robotic arm
(SPIDER) operating on a spatial platform is presented.  The system has been
realized in the framework of the JERICO (Joint European Robotics In-orbit
Calibration Operation mission) project. The application domain is represented
in the Situation Calculus and the planner is realized in GOLOG.

<P>
Other forms of representation and reasoning of dynamic systems have also been
studied. In [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CHENX_R">68</A>], robots program are represented using a
suitable process algebra and reasoning is performed via model checking. While
in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_DEGIA_I_R">77</A>] planning techniques for temporal extended goals based
on synthesis of automata in infinite strings are introduced.

Complexity of Reasoning</A>
</H3>

<P>
Efficiency of AI systems is important for their success, as it is important
in all engineering projects.  If we are to use logic as the major tool for
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning we have to deal with computational
aspects.

<P>
Logical inference is an extraordinarily powerful computational device, and
problems in logic are known among computer scientists for their high
computational complexity. As an example, the prototypical recursively
enumerable, non-recursive problem is to check whether a formula of first-order
logic is valid.  In other words a reasoner that represents its knowledge
by means of a first-order formula and uses a sound and complete procedure for
checking the validity of its knowledge has as much computational power as a
Turing machine.  The reasoner might give up full expressiveness and represent
its knowledge in formulae of propositional logic, still using a sound and
complete consistency checking procedure.  In this case, it is important to
recall that checking whether a formula of propositional logic is consistent is
the paradigmatic NP-complete problem, which means that the reasoner faces a
problem which probably requires exponential time.

<P>
In 1998, the AI group has continued the investigation on fundamental properties
of complexity of reasoning, with the overall goal of designing computationally
efficient and adequately expressive systems for Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning. In particular, research has focused on the following topics:

<P>
As for point&nbsp;<A HREF="res-report-98.html#general">1</A>,
the paper [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_B_C">42</A>] shows that one of the most widely believed result
in proof complexity is flawed. It shows that the family <I>S</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB> of size <I>O</I>(2<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>)
of unsatisfiable formulae defined by Cook and Reckhow [Proc. of the ACM Symp. on Theory of Comp. 1974] does not give the exponential lower bound claimed in
that paper and presents a proof whose size has an upper bound of <I>O</I>(<I>n</I>
2<SUP><I>n</I><SUP>2</SUP></SUP>). The pitfalls in that and many other paper which ``proved'' the
flawed result are also explained.

<P>
As for point&nbsp;<A HREF="res-report-98.html#complexity">2</A>,
the computational complexity of various deduction formalisms for modal logic
is analyzed in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_A_R">81</A>],
where new bounds for establishing
decidability for modal logic K4 are also established.
The complexity of several variants of default logics is
studied in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_LIBER_B_C">40</A>].

<P>
As for point&nbsp;<A HREF="res-report-98.html#expressiveness">3</A>,
a language based on the non-monotonic formalism of ``circumscription'', which
extends the well-known query language Datalog, is defined and analyzed in 
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CADOL_B_J">6</A>]. The language has been implemented, adding some syntactic features that make it
useful as a specification language. The implementation, named <SMALL>NP-SPEC</SMALL>, is
described in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CADOL_D_C">19</A>]. The effects on the expressive power of a rule-based
query language when integrated with a description logic knowledge base are
investigated in 
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CADOL_B_C">17</A>]. 
<P>
As for point&nbsp;<A HREF="res-report-98.html#compilation">4</A>, a first contribution to this technique, which
splits theorem proving into a preprocessing phase (<EM>off-line reasoning</EM>),
and a query answering phase (<EM>on-line reasoning</EM>), is a survey on the
most recent advances of the field
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CADOL_A_J">5</A>]. The paper
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_LIBER_A_C">39</A>] contains the results of an investigation on how preprocessing may
be useful for many problems from different fields, such as diagnosis,
and reasoning about actions.

<P>
As for point&nbsp;<A HREF="res-report-98.html#experimental">5</A>, an algorithm for the evaluation of
``quantified boolean formulae'' is described in
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CADOL_A_C">16</A>]. Such formulae provide prototypical problems for many complexity classes
extremely relevant to Knowledge Representation.  The algorithm has been
designed and implemented in C++.

<P>
Further extensive experimental studies on the traditional benchmark on random
CNF of fixed size and the industrial benchmarks of I.F.I.P. for hardware
verification are shown in 
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_C_C">43</A>]. The analysis concerns the effect of embedding constraint propagation
techniques in traditional tableaux systems and their comparative advantage over
analytic cut.

<P>
The work of the AI group in the field of experimental analysis of reasoning
procedures is also witnessed by the organization of the 2nd Modal System
Comparison for the TABLEAUX-99 Conference. The organization and design criteria
of the comparison are described in [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_B_R">82</A>] and constitute
already a reference benchmark in the field.

<P>
As for point&nbsp;<A HREF="res-report-98.html#approximation">6</A>, the so-called <EM>Greatest Lower
 Bounds-approximations</EM>, previously defined by other authors, are analyzed from
the semantical and computational point of view in
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CADOL_C_C">18</A>]. In particular the cost of obtaining approximations is evaluated and efficient
algorithms are proposed.

<P>
Propositional modal logics have two independent sources of complexity:
unbounded logical omniscience and unbounded logical introspection. The paper
[<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_MASSA_A_C">41</A>] presents an approximation method to tame both of them, by
merging propositional approximations with a new technique tailored for
multi-modal logics. On this semantics we build an anytime proof procedure which
yields approximate proofs whose precision increases as we have more resources
(time, space etc.).

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00025800000000000000">
Knowledge-Based Architectures for Planning and Scheduling</A>
</H3>

<P>
The work concerns the realization of flexible architectures for
solving planning and scheduling problems, where an user can actively
participate to the solving process.  In the recent years, this
research has focussed on three main aspects involved in the design of
such architectures: the realization of specialized constraint
management modules, which are the ``basic layer'' of the constraint
satisfaction approach used as automatic solving method; the definition
of a set of scheduling heuristics for solving different classes of
problems; the design of a user interface to support a collaborative
problem solving between a user and the automated system.  In the
current year the activity has been devoted to study scheduling
algorithms for different problems characterized by cumulative capacity
constraints, and to the development of a open software architecture
for a class of scheduling problems.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00025810000000000000">
Scheduling Heuristics.</A>
</H4>

<P>
Different research results have been obtained that concerns scheduling
problems where resources may have capacity greater than one (a
resource may serve more than one activity at the same time
- --cumulative resource constraints).

<P>
In the paper [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_ODDIA_C">46</A>] the MCJSSP (Multi-Capacitated Job-Shop
Scheduling Problem) is considered.  This problem is a modified version
of usual Job-Shop problem where cumulative resources are also represented.
A tabu search approach is proposed that works on a particular decomposition
of the current solution that allows two kinds of moves by which to
modify a selected solution.  Interesting experimental results with
respect to current benchmarks are described.

<P>
The other two problems are characterized by the use of a rather
general representations of temporal constraints.  The specification is
introduced of maximum temporal separation constraints between pairs of
activities.  This particular metric constraints makes the scheduling
problem computationally very difficult.

<P>
In the work [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CESTA_A_C">30</A>] the problem MCM-SP
(Multi-Capacitated Metric Scheduling Problem) is considered.  This
problem have the basic structure of Job-Shop problem but allows the
specification of metric separations between activities and cumulative
resource constraints.  A previously reported algorithm, named Conflict
Free Solution Algorithm (CFSA), is first evaluated against a set of
problems of increasing dimension and shown to be of limited
effectiveness.  Two variations of this algorithm are then introduced
which incorporate measures of temporal flexibility as an alternative
heuristic basis for directing the search, and the variant making
broadest use of these search heuristics is shown to yield significant
performance improvement.  Observations about the tendency of the CFSA
solution approach to produce unnecessarily overconstrained solutions
then lead to development of a second heuristic algorithm, named Early
Start Time Algorithm (ESTA).  ESTA is shown to be the most effective
of the set, both in terms of its ability to efficiently solve problems
of increasing scale and its ability to produce schedules that minimize
overall completion time while retaining solution robustness.
In a second work [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CESTA_B_C">31</A>], on the same extended
class of scheduling problems two different solution approaches are
compared: (a)&nbsp;a profile-based procedure - which relies on local
analysis of potential resource conflicts to heuristically direct the
problem solving process, and (b)&nbsp;a clique-based procedure - which
exploits a global analysis of resource conflicts at greater
computational cost.  In each case, improvements are made to previously
proposed techniques.  Performance results are given on a series of
problems of increasing scale and constrainedness, indicating the
relative strengths of each procedure.

<P>
The work [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CESTA_A_R">66</A>] addresses a quite general scheduling
problem known as Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with
Generalized Precedence Relations (RCPSP/max).  In this problem
activities to be executed on a set of resources are temporally
connected by separation constraints that form a graph, each activity
may require more then one resource and different size of the same
resource.  In the paper a heuristic approach is
presented that consist of an iterative sampling procedure based on a
basic greedy algorithm that built a solution by leveling resource
requirements profiles to eliminate Minimal Critical Sets of
activities.  An experimental evaluation with benchmarks of the
Operation Research literature shows the competitiveness of the
algorithm with respect to existing approaches.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00025820000000000000">
A Software Architecture for Scheduling Applications.</A>
</H4>  In
a project supported by Italian Space Agency (ASI) we are designing a
reconfigurable architecture for developing different scheduling
problems.

<P>
In the paper [<A
 HREF="res-report-98.html#I_4_CESTA_B_R">67</A>] a general view is given of
different steps behind the generation of O-OSCAR (Object-Oriented
Scheduling Architecture) an open software framework to address
scheduling problems with an artificial intelligence constraint-based
approach.  Different basic modules are composed to allow the
representation and solution of classes of different scheduling
problems, their adaptation to different application environments and
different attitudes of users.  Particular attention is given to
functionalities of dynamic schedule manipulation and maintenance.

<P>
In a further work, still unreported, a complete system has been
realized for managing quantitative networks of temporal constraints.
The system named <EM>T-NETmanager</EM> allows the randomized generation
of temporal networks according to different generation parameters,
their management through different dynamic manipulation algorithms and
their visualization.  The system can be used as a separate module to
support planning and scheduling architectures, to test different
constraint propagation algorithms using reproducible random networks,
and for basic temporal reasoning didactics.

Natural Language Processing</A>

<P>
The activity of the Natural Language Group focused, in 1998, on the
study of knowledge-based methods for automatic text summarization.
The combination of an Information Extraction system (SRI's FASTUS)
with a text generator internally developed was investigated as a valid
alternative to the traditional approach to summarization based on
passage extraction and statistical models. A new architecture for
generating text from Message Understanding Conference templates, a
widely spread target representation for Information Extraction
systems, was devised. A proof-of-concept system was implemented along
this architecture and validated through extensive experiments
