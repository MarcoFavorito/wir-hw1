<H2>1.Introduction</H2>

We are presenting a technique for calibrating the internal parameters
of a camera, that does not require any calibration grid or knowledge
about 3D world points.

The relation between distorted and undistorted frame coordinates is
<P>i = ( id - Ox ) * ax * ( 1 + k1 * rd^2 ) + Ox</P>
<P>j = ( jd - Oy ) * ( 1 + k1 * rd^2 ) + Oy</P>

By knowing k1, Ox, Oy, ax, (Px and Py) it is possible to undistort the image
so that it can be considered as coming from a pinhole camera.

<H2>3. Computing Hough Transform of the binary image</H2>

<P>
The Hough Transform is a robust and effective method for
finding lines fitting a set of points. It  also provides
an easy way to compute the curvature of a set of point that are
supposed to be on a line.

<P>
The transformation from (x,y) plane to (r,t) plane is achieved by
associating every point P(x,y) with the following curve in the (r,t) plane
<P>r = x * cos(t) + y * sin(t)</P>

At the same time a point in (r,t) correspond to a line in (x,y).

<P>
This representation is unique and complete
as long as 0 <= t < PI.

<P>
A graphical representation of the Hough transform (HT) 
can be produced by generating a discrete grid of (r,t) plane,
and by defining HT(r,t) as the number of points in (x,y) plane
whose curve pass through (r,t).<BR>
The best fitting lines correspond to local maxima of HT(r,t).<BR>

<P>
The following picture shows the Hough transform of the above binary
image, with the following orientation for the axes.

<P>
The ten groups of brighter pixels correspond to the ten
lines in the image. Parallel lines in the (x,y) plane are 
horizontally aligned in HT, since they have (almost) the same t.<BR>
Note also that, as the lines in the image are not straight, 
the local maxima in HT are blurred.

<H2>4. Measuring distortion</H2>

<P>
In order to find values for undistorting the image we need a measure
of distortion, that is a measure of the curvature of the lines. 


<P>
A possible measure for the curvature of a set of points is given by
<P>eR = SUM(dist(Pi,R))</P>
where R is the best line fitting the points.<BR>

Moreover if there are many possible lines the overall curvature
can be defined as the sum of the curvature for each line
<P>E = SUM(SUM(dist(Pij,Rj)))</P>
In this case we need to know for every line which are the points
belonging to that line.


<P>
Now given a point P (xP,yP) and a line R in the (x,y) plane
(let (rR,tR) be the coordinates of R in the Hough domain),
the distance between P and R is
<P>dist(P,R) = | rR - ( xP * cos(tR) + yP * sin(tR) ) |</P>

<P>
The curvature of R is given by
<P>eR = SUM_(r in Dr) ((rR-r)^2 * HT(r,tR))</P>
and the overall distortion is
<P>E = SUM_R (eR)

The method does not require to know the list of points belonging
to each line (by not considering points that are farther away from the
best fitting line than a given factor Dr).
Moreover local maxima in HT can be easily detected with a limited
local search.

<H2>5. Minimizing distortion</H2>

<P>
The objective is to find values of the calibration parameters (k1, Ox, Oy, ax)
that minimize the distortion of an image.<BR>

However the search in this four dimensional space is not trivial,
and a good strategy is required to get good results.

<P>
The following figures show the undistorted image and the Hough Transform
of its binary image.

Notice the difference in the Hough Transform of the distorted
and the undistorted image. In the second the local maxima are
much better defined.
