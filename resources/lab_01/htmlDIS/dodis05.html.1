  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We provide formal definitions and 
    efficient secure techniques for - turning biometric and other noisy data into 
    keys usable for *any* cryptographic application, and - reliably and securely 
    authenticating biometric data. Our techniques apply not just to biometric 
    information, but to any keying material that, unlike traditional cryptographic 
    keys, is (1) not reproducible precisely and (2) not distributed uniformly. 
    We propose two new primitives. A *fuzzy extractor* extracts nearly uniform 
    randomness R from its biometric input; the extraction is error-tolerant in 
    the sense that R will be the same even if the input changes, as long as it 
    remains reasonably close to the original. Thus, R can be used as a key in 
    any cryptographic application. A *secure sketch* produces public information 
    about its biometric input w that does not reveal w, and yet allows exact recovery 
    of w given another value that is close to w. Thus, it can be used to reliably 
    reproduce error-prone biometric inputs without incurring the security risk 
    inherent in storing them. In addition to formally introducing our new primitives, 
    we provide nearly optimal constructions of both primitives for various measures 
    of "closeness" of input data, such as Hamming distance, edit metric, permutation 
    distance and set difference. If time permits, some follow-up work will be 
    mentioned. The talk will be introductory and self-contained. </font></P>
