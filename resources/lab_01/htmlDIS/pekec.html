<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
Tools from game theory have become fashionable and quite successful in tackling
interesting combinatorial optimization and distributed computing problems. On the other
hand, importing CS techniques into classical microeconomic research themes such as
auction theory and mechanism design has exposed real-life impracticability of
some economic theory findings, and has opened some interesting new research questions in
algorithm analysis and design.
In this talk, I will illustrate this interplay between algorithmic and mechanism
design issues on the example of "combinatorial auctions". Combinatorial auctions are
mechanisms that allow for a simultaneous sale of multiple items and allow
"all-or-nothing" bids on combinations of these items. In particular, I will show how
some of the issues in combinatorial auction design have been succesfully addressed
by applying results from combinatorial optimization, complexity theory and data structures.
Finally, I will discuss how some outstanding issues translate to well-defined problems that the
computer science community has not studied yet, but ought to be able to tackle.
