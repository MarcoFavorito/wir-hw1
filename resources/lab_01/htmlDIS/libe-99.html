In this paper we consider the problem of finding minimal models
of a set of propositional clauses.   This problem has many
applications:   for instance, finding minimal-length plans,
minimal diagnosis, and solving many other minimization and
maximization problems.   We have adapted the Davis-Putnam
algorithm (that finds generic models of a set of clauses) in
order to find minimal models.   Experiments have been performed to
determine which heuristics can be useful, and to decide in which
cases the problem is hard and in which cases it is easy.   A
comparison with a local search algorithm is also shown.
