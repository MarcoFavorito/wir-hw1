As an alternative to planning, an approach to high-level agent control based
on concurrent program execution is considered. A formal definition in the
situation calculus of such a programming language is presented and illustrated
with a detailed example. The language includes facilities for prioritizing the
concurrent execution, interrupting the execution when certain conditions
become true, and dealing with exogenous actions. The language differs from
other procedural formalisms for concurrency in that the initial state can be
incompletely specified and the primitive actions can be user-defined by axioms
in the situation calculus.
