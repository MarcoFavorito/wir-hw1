<H1> Ground Nonmonotonic Modal Logics for Knowledge Representation </H1>


<H2> Abstract </H2>

In this paper we discuss ground logics, a family of nonmonotonic modal
logics, with the goal of using them in knowledge representation.  Ground
logics are based on the idea of minimizing the knowledge expressed by
non-modal formulae.  The nonmonotonic character of the logics can be
described either by a fix-point equation or by means of a preference
relation on possible-worlds models.  We address both the epistemological
and the computational properties of ground logics.  We discuss their
representational features and provide a thorough comparison with McDermott
and Doyle logics.  Then, we show that reasoning in ground logics is
$\Pi^p_3$-hard, and prove that $\Pi^p_3$ is also an upper bound for reasoning
in the major ground logics.  Moreover, we identify some special cases where
the complexity of reasoning in ground logics is lower than in the general
case.
