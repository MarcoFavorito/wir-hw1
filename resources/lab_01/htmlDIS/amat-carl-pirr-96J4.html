Commonsense reasoning is the reasoning of agents interactingwith the real
world. Non monotonic reasoning is a well developed research area gathering



the logical formalismsthat treat commonsense reasoning. One of the best
known of such formalisms is Default logic. In this paper we discuss Default
logic at both the proof-theoretic and semantics levels and show that Default
logic provides a clear and formal framework to understand the logical nature
of commonsense reasoning
