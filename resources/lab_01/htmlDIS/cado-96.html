It is well known that problems in Logic, Automated Deduction and Artificial
Intelligence are very much demanding from the computational point of view.
Two of the techniques that have been proposed for addressing such
computational difficulties are Knowledge Compilation and Knowledge
Approximation. The central idea of the former technique is to split the goal of
answering to the question whether a query is logically entailed by a knowledge
base in two phases: In the first one the knowledge base is preprocessed, thus
obtaining an appropriate data structure (such a phase is sometimes called
off-line reasoning); in the second phase, the query is actually answered using
the output of the first phase (such a phase is sometimes called on-line
reasoning). The goal of preprocessing is to make on-line reasoning
computationally easier wrt query answering in the case when no preprocessing
at all is done. In Knowledge Approximation the central idea is to give up
either soundness or completeness when answering to a logical query. Obviously,
also in this case one aims at using less computational resources than in the
sound and complete case. The two techniques can be used together: In such a
case we have a method for approximate Knowledge Compilation.
