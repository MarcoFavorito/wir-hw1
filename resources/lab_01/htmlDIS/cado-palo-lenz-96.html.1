This paper investigates the possibility of exploiting formal analysis tools
developed in the database field for the purpose of studying the expressive
power of description logics augmented with rule-based query languages. We
report a preliminary analysis on the expressive power of such hybrid
languages. Two specific languages coupling a terminological component with
Horn rules are considered. It is shown that: (1) the former language defines all
database collections expressed by skolemized universally quantified second
order formulae where quantified predicates are monadic, and (2) the latter
language defines all by skolemized universally quantified second order formulae



where quantified predicates are dyadic or monadic.
