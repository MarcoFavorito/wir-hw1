The school timetabling problem regards the weekly scheduling for all the
classes of a high school. The problem consists in assigning lectures to periods
in such a way that no teacher or class is involved in more than one lecture at a
time. This problem has been proved NP-complete and is usually tackled using
heuristic methods. This paper reports an on going experimentation with local
search techniques (e.g. Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search) for school
timetabling. Our experiments give a comparative analysis of the effectiveness
of the various techniques for this specific problem. In addition, we explore
some issues related to the type of move allowed for the navigation of the
search space and we discuss which is the best structure for the objective
function so as to make the search capabilities of the technique more effective.
