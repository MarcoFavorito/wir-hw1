<h1>Minimal belief and negation as failure in multi-agent systems</h1>

<H2>Abstract </H2>

<p>
We propose an epistemic, nonmonotonic approach to the formalization of
knowledge in a multi-agent setting.  From the technical viewpoint, a
family of nonmonotonic logics, based on Lifschitz's modal logic of minimal
belief and negation as failure, is proposed, which allows for
formalizing an agent which is able to reason about both its own
knowledge and other agents' knowledge and ignorance. We define a
reasoning method for such a logic and characterize the computational
complexity of the major reasoning tasks in this formalism. From the
practical perspective, we argue that our logical framework is
well-suited for representing situations in which an agent cooperates
in a team, and each agent is able to communicate his knowledge to
other agents in the team. In such a case, in many situations the agent
needs nonmonotonic abilities, in order to reason about such a
situation based on his own knowledge and the other agents' knowledge
and ignorance. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our framework in
the robotic soccer application domain.
