A knowledge base is redundant if it contains parts that can be
inferred from the rest of it.   We study some problems related to
the redundancy of a CNF formula.   In particular, any CNF formula
can be made irredundant by deleting some of its clauses:   what
results is an irredundant equivalent subset.   We study the
complexity of problems related to irredundant equivalent subsets:
verification, checking existence of an irredundant equivalent
subset with a given size, checking necessary and possible
presence of clauses in irredundant equivalent subsets, and
uniqueness.   We also consider the problem of redundancy with
different definitions of equivalence.
