                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>One of the main
                   characteristics of knowledge representation systems based on the
                   description of concepts is the clear distinction between terminological  and  assertional  knowledge.  Although  this  characteristic
                   leads to several computational and representational advantages,
                   it usually limits the expressive power of the system. For this reason, some attempts have been done, allowing for a limited form of
                   amalgamation between the two components and a more complex
                   interaction between them. In particular, one of these attempts is
                   based on letting the individuals to be referenced in the concept
                   expressions. This is generally performed by admitting a constructor for building a concept from a set of enumerated individuals.<p>
                   In this paper we investigate the consequences of introducing this
                   type of constructors in the concept description language. We also
                   provide a complete reasoning procedure to deal with these constructors and we obtain some complexity results on it.<p>
