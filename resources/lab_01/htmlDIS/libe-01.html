The idea of preprocessing part of the input of a problem in order
to improve efficiency has been employed by several researchers in
several areas of computer science.   In this paper we show
sufficient conditions to prove that an intractable problem cannot
be efficiently solved even allowing an exponentially long
preprocessing phase.   The generality of such conditions is shown
by applying them to various problems coming from different
fields.   While the results may seem to discourage the use of
compilation, we present some evidence that such negative results
are useful in practice.
