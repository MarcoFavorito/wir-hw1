				<p>Exchange Server 2003 delivers breakthrough advances in information worker productivity and network performance. Who benefits from these advances?

<UL>
<LI>Information workers get their work done more quickly because Exchange 2003 and Outlook 2003 work together to deliver consistently efficient access to personal business information independent of network characteristics. Mobile users find it easier than ever to stay up-to-date with the information flowing into their office mailboxes no matter what device they choose to use.
<LI>Information technology (IT) managers appreciate advances in administration, security, scalability, reliability, and built-in support for mobile computing that both lower the costs of managing an Exchange-based communications infrastructure and make it easier to deliver mission-critical messaging services.
</UL>
<P>
Improvements in the way Exchange Server 2003 and Outlook 2003 work together dramatically improve the performance of Outlook over low or fluctuating bandwidth conditions. Checking e-mail over a dial-up connection or low-bandwidth mobile network, such as GPRS (general packet radio service) and 1xRTT (single carrier radio transmission technology) CDMA, feels much more like working in the office. Using the new Outlook 2003 user interface (UI) makes it faster and easier for information workers to optimize their e-mail.
<P>
Information workers rely on Outlook Web Access to reach their personal business information from any computer connected to the Internet. With Exchange Server 2003, Outlook Web Access now features a UI very similar to that found in Outlook 2003, providing users with a consistent experience whether they are connecting from their desktop computer or an Internet kiosk. In addition to improvements in the areas of security and performance, Outlook Web Access supports more Outlook functionality, including a spelling checker, task management, and anti-spam protection.
