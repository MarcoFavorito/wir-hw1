      <p>Abstract:&quot;<font size="1">The deployment of server replicas of a 
        given service across an asynchronous distributed system (e.g. Internet) 
        is a real practical challenge. This target cannot be indeed achieved by 
        classical software replication techniques (e.g. passive and active replication) 
        as these techniques usually rely on group communication toolkits that 
        require server replicas to run over a partially synchronous distributed 
        system. This paper proposes a threetier architecture for software replication 
        that encapsulates the need of partial synchrony in a specific software 
        component of a mid-tier to free replicas (end-tier) and clients (client-tier) 
        from the need of underlying partial synchrony assumptions. Then we propose 
        how to specialize the mid-tier in order to manage active replication of 
        server replicas.</font>&quot;</p>

        technical report #27-01.</p>
      <p>Abstract:&quot;<font size="1">The synchronization among thin, independent 
        and concurrent processes in an open distributed system is a fundamental 
        issue in current architectures (e.g. middlewares, three-tier architectures 
        etc.). &#147;Independent process&#148; means no message has to be exchanged 
        among the processes to synchronize themselves and &#147;open&#148; means 
        that the number of processes that require to synchronize changes along 
        the time. In this paper we present the speci.cation of a sequencer service 
        that allows independent processes to get a sequence number that can be 
        used to label successive operations (e.g. to allow a set of independent 
        and concurrent processes to get a total order on these labelled operations). 
        Moreover, we propose an implementation of the sequencer service in the 
        timed asynchronous model along with its correctness proof.&quot;</font></p>

      <p>Abstract:&quot;<font size="1">A replication logic is the set of protocols 
        and mechanisms implementing a software replication technique. A three-tier 
        approach to replication consists in separating the replication logic from 
        both clients and replicated servers by embedding such logic in a mid-tier. 
        In this paper we first introduce the fundamental concepts underlying three-tier 
        replication. This approach has two main practical advantages: (i) it allows 
        to maintain consistency among the state of server replicas deployed within 
        an asynchronous distributed system and (ii) it supports very thin clients. 
        Then we present the Interoperable Replication Logic (IRL) architecture, 
        which is a Fault Tolerant CORBA compliant infrastructure exploiting a 
        three-tier approach to replicate stateful deterministic CORBA objects. 
        Finally a detailed description of an IRL prototype developed in our department 
        is proposed along with an extensive performance analysis.&quot;</font></p>

      <p>Abstract:&quot;<font size="1">Cooperative information systems are characterized

        interoperable, dependable services on top of which the development of

        changing either the application code or the middleware's one. However, 
        interceptors could be non-intuitive and this could in turn limit their 
        use on a large scale. In this paper we present results of an investigation 
        on CORBA portable interceptors in Java on various CORBA platforms. This 
        study includes the identification of the basic mechanisms provided by 
        an interceptor, of their limitations, a proxy-based technique to overcome

      <p>Abstract:&quot;<font size="1">The Common Object Request Broker Architecture 
        (CORBA) is one of the most popular standard for middleware platforms based 
        on object technology. CORBA shields distributed applications from the 
        heterogeneity of the bare distributed system. Till recently CORBA did 
        not address the fault tolerance issue which is actually one of the core 
        aspects of distributed applications running upon an heterogeneous environment. 
        As a consequence, in the last few years many research proposals have appeared 
        in the literature to add reliability and availability to CORBA applications. 
        This paper first analyzes the advantages and drawbacks of such proposals 
        and shows that none of them completely exploits the platform independence 
        provided by CORBA. Then it proposes a novel CORBA-compliant approach, 
        which differs in allowing the deployment of a dependable infrastructure 
        in heterogeneous environments.</font>&quot;</p>
