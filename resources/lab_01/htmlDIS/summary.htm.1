<h1>Project summary</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

Our principle objective is to provide an advanced system for information
integration, which is innovative in the following respects:

<ul>
<li> advanced reasoning capabilities
<li>handling of semi-structured data
<li>declarative user-interaction
<li>handling of incomplete and inconsistent data sources.
</ul>

<h2>Description of work</h2>

<p>Information integration is the task of providing a uniform interface to
various pre-existing data sources, so as to enable users to focus on
specifying what they want, rather than thinking of how to obtain the
answer. As a result, an information integration system frees the users from
the tasks of finding the relevant data sources, interacting with each
source in isolation, and selecting, cleaning, and combining data from
multiple sources. The proposed project aims at providing a solid theory and
innovative methodologies for future flexible information integration
systems. In particular, advanced reasoning capabilities by means of
computational logic, handling of semi-structured data, declarative user
interaction, possibilities to deal with incomplete and inconsistent data
sources, extendibility and scalability are important and yet open issues,
which will be tackled and resolved in this project. In addition, a
prototype system will be developed in order to assess the validity and
usability of our approach. We point out that especially the scalability
desideratum is challenging and bears high risk since comparable techniques
are currently insufficient in this respect, so it is unclear whether this
requirement can be met.</p>

<p>However, upon success the benefits will be ample: Not only will
companies, organizations, and other enterprises be able to integrate their
internal data at high level of competence and in an efficient manner; also
inter-organizational, and large scale distributed information systems will
become feasible.</p>
