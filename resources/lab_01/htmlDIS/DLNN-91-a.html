Concept languages provide a means for expressing knowledge about hierarchies
of concepts, i.e. classes of objects with common properties. The basic reasoning
tasks to be performed on concepts are satisfiability checking and subsumption
checking. Although concept languages have been widely used in AI-systems,
only in rare cases complete algorithms have been known. The few complexity
results that have been obtained gave mostly lower bounds and were not
related to each other. In this paper we consider a family of languages, called
AL -languages, which covers most of the concept languages considered in the
literature. The paper has two functions. First, we develop a general technique
for checking satisfiability and subsumption of AL  -concepts, which is based on
the tableau calculus for predicate logic. Second, we use this algorithmic
technique to give precise upper and lower bounds for the AL  -languages, thus



providing a complete analysis of the computational complexity of the
satisfiability and the subsumption problem for concept languages.
