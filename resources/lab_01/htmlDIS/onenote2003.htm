<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Microsoft® Office OneNote™ 2003, a new program in 
the Microsoft Office System of products, allows users to electronically capture, 
organize, and reuse notes on a laptop, desktop, or Tablet PC. OneNote 2003 
provides a single place to collect and customize notes as you like-capturing 
information in multiple ways and organizing it according to your 
needs.</FONT></DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<DIV><BR>With OneNote 2003, the everyday act of note-taking becomes a dynamic 
and integral part of your work. OneNote allows you to:<BR></DIV>
<UL>
  <LI>Take down notes as you like.</LI>
  <LI>Organize information easily.</LI>
  <LI>Access information quickly.</LI>
  <LI>Reuse and share notes effectively.<BR></LI></UL>
<DIV>Microsoft Office OneNote 2003 helps you become more productive by 
transforming the note-taking process into an active and effective part of your 
day. Rather than transcribing paper-based notes into electronic form, you can 
capture your notes electronically so they are ready for distribution as soon as 
a meeting concludes. Add to that the ability to insert diagrams and Web 
research, and business notes transform from something that pile up unused and 
forgotten into a central part of your business process. OneNote 2003 helps 
you:<BR></DIV>
<UL>
  <LI>Increase efficiency by centralizing all notes electronically.</LI>
  <LI>Reduce downtime associated with note transcription.</LI>
  <LI>Boost productivity by easily integrating OneNote content into other 
  Microsoft Office programs.</FONT></LI></UL>
