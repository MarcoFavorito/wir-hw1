Nonmonotonic formalisms and belief revision operators have been introduced
as useful tools to describe and reason about evolving scenarios. Both
approaches have been proven effective in a number of different situations.
However, little is known about their relationship. Previous work by Winslett
has shown some correlations between a specific operator and circumscription.
In this paper we greatly extend Winslett's work by establishing new relations
between circumscription and a large number of belief revision operators. This
highlights similarities and differences between these formalisms. Furthermore,
these connections provide us with the possibility of importing results in one
field into the other one.
