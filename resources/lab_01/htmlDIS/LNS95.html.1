                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Typically,
                   spreadsheet applications are difficult to use for casual users (different  from  developers),  mainly  because  of  lack  of  support.  In
                   fact,  building a tutoring facility for such applications is a time
                   consuming task. Our aim is the realization of a tool for the automatic generation of Intelligent Tutors for conventional spreadsheet applications. We have realized a system that takes a standard spreadsheet format as input, extracts an explicit representation of the problem solving pattern coded in the spreadsheet and
                   generates, in the native environment, a hypertextual guide and
                   an interactive tutor that can effectively support the casual user
                   in the use of the spreadsheet for the specific application it is designed for. Besides its great potential for application in the area
                   of spreadsheet systems, our proposal shows how to take advantage of the knowledge-based tutoring techniques in the construction of tools that effectively support the training of personnel for
                   standard computer applications.<p>
