                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this paper we
                   propose  an  enhanced  Propositional  Dynamic  Logic  for  reasoning about actions that includes boolean expressions of primitive
                   actions denoting sets of primitive actions executed concurrently,
                   and  that  allows  to  represent  interdependencies  between  primitive  actions  as  specialization  or  disjointness.  Furthermore  the
                   logic includes constructs to impose the determinism of boolean
                   combinations of primitive actions and their inverse. We establish
                   that such logic is decidable and its computational complexity is
                   EXPTIME (tight bound) and we show possible uses of this logic
                   in reasoning about actions by means of examples.<p>
