<H2> Abstract </H2>

The modal description logic ALCK both constitutes a promising framework for
reasoning about actions and allows for the formalization of several
non-first-order aspects of KR systems based on DLs.  However, other
nonmonotonic features of DL-based KR systems, in particular role and
concept closure inside the knowledge base, lack an intuitive formalization
in this modal framework.  To overcome these difficulties, we propose a
modification of the semantics for ALCK, which consists in allowing
selective minimization of primitive concepts and roles, thus providing for
a correct formalization of the notion of role and concept closure.
