  <p style="line-height: 150%"><b><font size="4" color="#000000">The School of
  Engineering of the University of Rome &quot;La Sapienza&quot; is in the very
  heart of the city, on one of the seven hystorical hills on which Rome was
  founded (the Esquilino Hill), a few steps from the Coliseum and side by side
  to the old church of S. Pietro in Vincoli (a church dedicated to St.Peter as a
  prisoner: &quot;in vinculi&quot; means: &quot;in chains&quot;), where the
  famous Michelangelo's masterpiece &quot;Moses&quot; is kept as a part of the
  never finished tomb of Pope Julius II Della Rovere.<br>
  As a point of fact the School is built in the area of the St.Peter's old
  monastery, built, in its turn, on the ruins of Nero's imperial palace known as
  Domus Aurea (that is: Golden House). The cloister of the School belongs to the
  old monastery and was designed by Giuliano da San Gallo: it is a magnificent
  example of Reinassance architecture in Rome. In the centre of it there is the
  17th century well, now become the symbol of the School. The old refectory,
  recently restored, is used for the most important ceremonies in the life of
  the School. </font></b></p>
