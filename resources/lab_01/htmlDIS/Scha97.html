The timetabling problem consists in fixing a sequence of meetings between
teachers and students in a prefixed period of time (typically a week), satisfying
a set of constraints of various types. A large number of variants of the
timetabling problem have been proposed in the literature, which differ from
each other based on the type of institution involved (university or high school)
and the type of constraints. This problem, that has been traditionally
considered in the operational research field, has recently been tackled with
techniques belonging also to artificial intelligence (e.g. genetic algorithms, tabu
search, and simulated annealing). In this paper, we survey the various
formulations of the problem, and the techniques and algorithms used for its
solution.
