<H1><B>Embedding minimal knowledge into autoepistemic logic</B></H1>

<H2>Abstract </H2>

<P>We investigate the epistemological properties of MKNF, Lifschitz's logic
of minimal knowledge and negation as failure. In particular, we show that
the expressive power of MKNF is equivalent to Moore's autoepistemic logic
(AEL), by defining an embedding of MKNF into AEL and vice versa. We also
prove that the negation as failure modality <I>not</I> of MKNF exactly
corresponds to the negative introspection operator in AEL. The two previous
results imply that MKNF's minimal knowledge modality K can be represented
by means of negation as failure <I>not</I>, i.e. MKNF theories admit an
equivalent representation in terms of unimodal theories using the <I>not</I>
operator only. This in turn implies that negation as failure is ``more
expressive'' than minimal knowledge. </P>
