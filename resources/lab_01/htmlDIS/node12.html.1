<DT><STRONG>1970</STRONG>
<DD><P>
She first worked on some problems related to pattern recognition.
<P>
She  worked on programming language semantics, program properties 
and their automatic proofs.  She defined a semantics for PASCAL in 
LCF (Logic for Computable Functions)  and machine checked several proofs of 
(nontrivial) properties.

<P>
She designed and implemented a theorem prover named PPC, 
Pisa Proof Checker; published some papers describing the (object 
oriented) programming paradigm used in its development, and its 
evaluator (an interpreter for the full lambda calculus).

<P>
She  participated and contributed to the development and use of 
Wehyrauch's FOL system.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>1980</STRONG>
<DD>She did work in office automation, personal computing and text
processing.  She contributed to the first installation of TEX on a IBM 
machine in Italy and developed an environment similar to Latex.

<P>
She has investigated on  the advantages of the use of meta-level 
knowledge in AI systems, both to control search and to do reasoning 
about reasoning in multi-agent systems.

<P>
In addition to some work in the area of Logic Programming and data 
bases, she  carried on some experiments of application 
of Artificial Intelligence techniques to the development of Expert 
Systems for medical diagnosis; she has also done some work in 
Intelligent Tutorins Systems, both for supporting the learning of 
scientific disciplines, and of English as a second language for 
Italians.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>1990</STRONG>
<DD>She has done some work on nonmonotonic reasoning.  Her 
interests have spanned from the characterization of default proofs, to 
tableau systems for default logic, to modal characterizations of 
defaul logic and definability of concepts of natural kinds.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>2000</STRONG>
<DD>
She has more recently started projects on Cognitive Robotics,  AI techniques
applied to  Security, and AI Planning.
