This paper describes an analyst-oriented approach to conceptual knowledge
representation and reasoning based on description logics. The approach is



introduced to model and analyse the static part of behavioural concepts used
in application domains. Behaviours are captured in a parametric way with
respect to the description logic which corresponds to the structural modelling
language. Structural concepts are classified according to the usual ISA
hierarchy, while behaviours are organised into a hierarchy based on
countervariance. Reasoning about the domain model is performed in terms of
subsumption and consistency in the adopted description logic, and complexity
results carry over. The proposed approach is used to formalise and reason on
process schemes introduced in the engineering of computer-based and
information systems, as well as in enterprise modelling.
