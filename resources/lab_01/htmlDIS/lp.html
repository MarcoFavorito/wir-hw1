    <H2>Logic Programming and Databases</H2>
    Logic programming studies focus on the generation of prime implicants, on
the relations between it and the abduction area, on the problem of establishing
the decidability of certain problems, on the resolution of problems over hypersets and concern also the semantics of non-Horn deductive databases.<p>
    A novel approach to generate prime implicants, presented in <A HREF="EPP94.html">[EPP94]</A><A HREF="EPP95.html">[EPP95]</A>,
is based on integer programming.  The problem of finding prime implicants is
transformed  into  an  equivalent  one  that  finds  the  solutions  of  a  set  of  linear
equations with constraints.  This task is accomplished by searching for the solution set of an equivalent problem of Integer Programming.  These works present
a generative algorithm which computes all prime implicants one at a time.  Such
approach has significant advantage over other methods.<p>
    Logic programming with abductive reasoning can be used in the realization
of a data dictionary with a particular methodology.  In <A HREF="PP94.html">[PP94]</A>, some methodological steps are represented by means of a set of rules augmented with integrity
constraints which capture the presence of incompatible concepts.  Explanations
for incompatibility can be inferred by exploiting abductive reasoning.  To this
end,  the paper presents a new proposal,  based on the minimization of threevalued models, for the computation of hypothesis where the theory is a general
logic program.<p>
    The problem of deciding certain classes of sentences for logic programming
with sets is presented in <A HREF="OPP95.html">[OPP95]</A>.  A rather general decision method for solving
this  problem  is  illustrated  through  the  treatment  of  membership  theories  of
increasing strength,  together with a sub-theory of Zermelo-Fraenkel,  which is
already complete with respect to these class of sentences.  The computational
property of this problem is established using a technique to restrict the universal
quantifier of the query.<p>
    The paper <A HREF="DOPR94.html">[DOPR94]</A> provides a system for solving equations over hypersets.  An algorithm for solving the NP-complete unification problem pertaining
to  hollow  hyper-set  terms  is  provided,  and  shown  to  be  totally  correct.   An
application to the matching of finite state automata is also hinted.<p>


    While the semantics of Horn deductive databases is well understood, many
different proposal have been presented in the literature to characterize the semantics of non-Horn deductive databases.  The paper <A HREF="Sch95b.html">[Sch95b]</A> presents a comparison and an attempt to reconcile the two major approaches to the treatment
of negation in deductive databases:  the logic programming view of clauses as
inference rules and the closed-world approach aiming at minimizing the positive
knowledge.<p>
