We present an attempt to reconcile the theoretical work on reasoning about
action with the realization of agents, in particular mobile robots.  Specifically,
we present a logical framework for representing dynamic systems based on
description logics, which allows for the formalization of sensing actions.  We
address the generation of conditional plans by defining a suitable reasoning
method in which a plan is extracted from a constructive proof of a query
expressing a given goal.  We also present an implementation of such a logical
framework, which has been tested on the mobile robot "Tino".
