<P><LI><H2>If a transaction Ti is aborted, all its actions have to be undone.  Not only that, if Tj reads an object last written by Ti,  Tj must be aborted as well!
</H2></P>

<P><LI><H2>Most systems avoid such cascading aborts by releasing a transaction’s locks only at commit time.
</H2></P>

<P><LI>If Ti writes an object, Tj can read this only after Ti commits.
</UL></UL><UL></P>

<P><LI><H2>In order to undo the actions of an aborted transaction, the DBMS maintains a log in which every write is recorded.  This mechanism is also used to recover from system crashes:  all active Xacts at the time of the crash are aborted when the system comes back up.</H2></P>
