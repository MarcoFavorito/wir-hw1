				<h3>Overview</H3>
<p>
Designed for medium to large businesses, Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, is the recommended operating system for servers running applications such as networking, messaging, inventory, and customer service systems; databases; and e-commerce Web sites. Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, delivers high reliability, performance, and superior business value and is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. 
<p>
Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, differs from Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, primarily in its support for high-performance servers and its ability to cluster servers for greater load handling. These capabilities provide reliability that helps ensure systems remain available—even if problems arise.
<p>
At a high level, Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, provides support for: 

<OL>
<LI>
<B>Eight-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).</B>  To increase server performance and capacity, you can add processors, an approach to increasing your network capacity is known as scaling up. The enhanced support for SMP allows you to add processors that work together—that is, use multiprocessor servers.

<LI>
<B>Eight-node clustering.</B>  Server clusters up to eight nodes are available only in Windows 2003, Enterprise Edition, and Windows 2003, Datacenter Edition. 

<LI>
<B>32 gigabytes (GB) of RAM in 32-bit editions, 64 GB in 64-bit editions.</B>  By adding memory, a computer can work with more information at once. Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, includes enhanced memory capabilities that let you increase the memory available for server processing to as much as 32 GB of RAM in 32-bit editions and 64 GB of RAM in 64-bit editions.
