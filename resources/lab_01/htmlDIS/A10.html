  Handling numerical information is one of the most important research issues
for practical applications of first-order learning systems.
This paper is concerned with the problem of inducing first-order
 classification rules from both numeric and symbolic data.
We propose a specialization operator that discretizes continuous data
during the learning process.The heuristic function used to choose
among different discretizations satisfies a property that can be profitably eploited to improve the efficiency of the specialization operator. The operator has been implemented and tested on the document
understanding domain.
