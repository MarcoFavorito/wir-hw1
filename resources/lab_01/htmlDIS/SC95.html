                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Problems       in
                   logic are well-known to be hard to solve in the worst case. Two
                   different strategies for dealing with this aspect are known from
                   the literature: language restriction and theory approximation. In
                   this paper we are concerned with the second strategy. Our main
                   goal  is  to  define  a  semantically  well-founded  logic  for  approximate reasoning, which is justifiable from the intuitive point of
                   view, and to provide fast algorithms for dealing with it even when
                   using expressive languages. We also want our logic to be useful to
                   perform approximate reasoning in different contexts. We define
                   a method for the approximation of decision reasoning problems
                   based on multivalued logics. Our work expands and generalizes
                   in  several  directions  ideas  presented  by  other  researchers.  The
                   major features of our technique are:

                      o  approximate  answers  give  semantically  clear  information
                         about the problem at hand;

                      o  approximate answers are easier to compute than answers to
                         the original problem;

                      o  approximate answers can be improved, and eventually they
                         converge to the right answer;

                      o  both  sound  approximations  and  complete  ones  are  described.<p>

                   The  method  we  propose  is  flexible  enough  to  be  applied  to  a
                   wide range of reasoning problems. In our research we considered
                   approximation of several decidable problems with different worstcase complexity, involving both propositional and first-order languages.  In  particular  we  defined  approximation  techniques  for:


                   propositional  logic,  fragments  of  first  order  logic  (concept  description  languages)  and  modal  logic.  In  our  research  we  also
                   addressed the issue of representing the knowledge of a reasoner
                   with limited resources and how to use such a knowledge for approximate reasoning purposes.<p>
