<H1> Classic Planning for Mobile Robots </H1>


<H2> Abstract </H2>

The paper describes an approach to reasoning about actions and plan
generation within the framework of description logics. Our proposal is
considered "classic" since it is in the style of deductive planning and it
relies upon the reasoning capabilities of description logics, that are
realized in the system CLASSIC.  From an epistemological point of view our
approach is based on the formalization of actions given by dynamic logics,
but we exploit their correspondence with description logics to turn the
formalization into an actual implementation. In particular, we are able to
carefully weaken the logical inference process, thus making the reasoning
of the robot computationally feasible.  From a practical viewpoint we use a
general purpose knowledge-based environment based on description logics,
and its associated reasoning tools, in order to plan the actions of the
mobile robot "Tino", starting from the knowledge about the environment and
the action specification.  The robot's reactive capabilities allow it to
execute such plans in the real world.
