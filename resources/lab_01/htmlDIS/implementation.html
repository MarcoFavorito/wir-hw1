The high-level architecture of the system is displayed in Figure 1.  Such an
architecture comprises five main modules:

<OL>

<LI>the <b>System Processor</b> elaborates and reasons about the specification
of the data integration system; </LI>

<LI>the <b>Query Processor</b> has the task of elaborating the user queries
expressed over the global schema, in order to reformulate such queries over the
sources; </LI>

<LI>the <b>Data Processor</b> executes the reformulated query, by retrieving
the data relevant for the query at the sources and computing the answers to the
query. In this module, source wrappers provide a relational view of data
sources; </LI>

<LI>the <b>Consistency Handler</b> is activated only when key dependencies are
defined on the global schema.  It detects the situations in which data at the
sources are not consistent with the key dependencies.  This requires, in the
worst case, to compute the retrieved global database;</LI>

<LI>the <b>Meta-Data Repository</b> stores an internal representation of the
intensional information, i.e., the system specification and the user queries.
</LI>

</OL>

Here we focus our attention on the System Processor and the Query Processor,
which we briefly describe in the following.  
<br><b><a href="#top">(back to top...)</a></b>

<a name="sp">
<h3>System Processor</h3>

The System Processor performs the following tasks:

<UL>

<LI>stores the system specification in the meta-data repository; </LI>

<LI>through the module <b>LAV-GAV Compiler</b>, transforms the LAV
specification into a GAV one; </LI>

<LI>through the module <b>ID Expander</b>, computes the transitive
closure of the inclusion dependencies expressed over the global schema: this
is realized in order to speed-up the query reformulation task; </LI>

<LI>through the module <b>System Analyzer</b>, verifies some properties of
the system. In particular:

  <ol>

  <li> verifies whether the system is non-key-conflicting

  <li> by solving query containment tasks, is able to derive formal properties
  about the system specification.

  </ol>

In particular, based on the constraints and the mapping, this module
establishes whether two global relations in a GAV system (or two source
relations in a LAV system) are equivalent, or contained one into the
other. We point out that query containment is computed by reducing this
problem to query answering, using a well-known technique (see
e.g. [JoKl84]. </LI>

</UL>

Notice that all the tasks performed by the System Processor only depend on the
system specification, therefore they are computed off-line, since all the
computation is independent of the query that has to be processed.

<h3>Query Processor</h3>

The Query Processor performs the following tasks:

<UL>
<LI>through the module <b>Query Reformulator</b>, computes the perfect
rewriting of the user query with respect to the IDs specified over the global
schema. Such a module essentially implements the algorithm <b>ID-rewrite</b>
</LI>

<LI>through the module <b>Query Unfolder</b>, unfolds the query produced by
the module <b>Query Reformulator</b>, thus producing a query that can be
evaluated overthe sources. Hence, this module essentially implements the
function <b>unfold</b> </LI>

<LI>through the module <b>Query Optimizer</b>, performs some optimizations on
the query produced by the previous module. In particular, the module identifies
and deletes redundant CQs in the rewriting (i.e., CQs subsumed by other
CQs). </LI>

</UL>

Notice that all the tasks performed by the Query Processor are computed at the
intensional level, since they are independent of the data at the sources.

<h3>Discussion</h3>

With regard to the Consistency Handler, explicit repair (or cleaning) of the
data violating key dependencies is made.  This is realized by a second query
processing module, driven by the Consistency Handler, which implements the
<b>loosely-sound semantics</b>.

The main purpose of the prototype above presented is to experiment the
effectiveness of our intensional approach to query processing. Indeed, our aim
is not only to arrive at an implementation of a general query answering
mechanism in an expressive data integration setting, but also to push query
processing as much as possible at the intensional level, following the
well-established approaches and technology in standard database systems. This
is a crucial issue especially in data integration applications, where the real
system bottleneck is typically the access to data sources.

We have run our system starting from the specification of data integration
settings taken from data warehouse applications: all such experiments have
shown that the intensional processing of queries is actually performed very
fast, despite the complexity of the tasks that are computed (which in the worst
case require time exponential in the size of the query and of the system
specification).

This prototype is part of a general system for data integration which is
currently under development within the research project <a
href="http:sv.mat.unical.it/infomix">INFOMIX</a> (project IST-2001-33570)
funded by the EU.  The main purpose of INFOMIX is to provide an advanced system
for information integration, which is innovative with respect to the state of
the art in terms of reasoning capabilities, handling incomplete and
inconsistent data sources, handling semi-structured data, and declarative
user-interaction.
