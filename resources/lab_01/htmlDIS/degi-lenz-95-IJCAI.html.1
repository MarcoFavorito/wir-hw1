In this paper we propose an enhanced Propositional Dynamic Logic for
reasoning about actions that includes boolean expressions of primitive actions
denoting sets of primitive actions executed concurrently, and that allows to
represent interdependencies between primitive actions as specialization or



disjointness. Furthermore the logic includes constructs to impose the
determinism of boolean combinations of primitive actions and their inverse.
We establish that such logic is decidable and its computational complexity is
EXPTIME (tight bound) and we show possible uses of this logic in reasoning
about actions by means of examples.
