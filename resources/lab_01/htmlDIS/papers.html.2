A methodology is presented which allows to design encoder, decoder and controller to stabilize a nonlinear
system in feedforward form using saturated <em>encoded</em> state feedback basically
under standard assumption, namely local Lipschitz
property of the vector field defining the system. <em>n</em> (respectively,
<em>n+1</em>)
bits are used to encode the state information needed to the purpose
of semi-globally (globally) stabilizing an n-dimensional
system. Minimality of the data rate is discussed.

A switched nonlinear system is considered, and the interval between two consecutive
switchings is assumed to be greater than a value called the "<em>dwell time</em>".
When switching among nonlinear systems, using a constant dwell time generally
fails to lead to stability. In this letter, a state dependent dwell time function with
convergence guarantees is presented for discrete-time stable nonlinear systems.

Encoded state feedback is a term which refers to the situation in which
the state
feedback signal is sampled every T units of time and
converted (encoded) into a binary representation.
In this note stabilization of nonlinear systems by encoded state
feedback is studied. It is shown
that <em>any</em> nonlinear control system which can
be globally asymptotically stabilized by "standard" (i.e. with no encoding)
state feedback can also be
globally asymptotically stabilized by encoded state feedback,
provided that the number of bits used to encode the samples  is not less
than an explicitly determined lower bound. By means of this bound, we are able
to establish a direct relationship between the <em>size</em> of the expected region of attraction
and the data rate, under the stabilizability assumption only,
a result which -- to the best of our knowledge -- does not have any precedent in the
literature.

The paper deals with  the supervisory control of a
nonlinear uncertain system in which the switching is directed by the
recently introduced state-dependent
dwell-time switching logic. The proposed supervisory
control architecture is shown to regulate to zero the state of the
system without requiring the switching to stop in
finite time. A significant class of systems to which
the control architecture
can be applied  is the class of linear systems with input saturation.

<br> The asymptotic convergence of a switched nonlinear
system in the presence of disturbances is studied.
The system switches among a family of integral input-to-state stable
systems. The time between two consecutive switchings is not less
than the dwell-time. The dwell-time is
allowed to take different values according to a function whose
argument is the state of the system at the switching times. We
propose a dwell-time function which  depends on the comparison
functions which characterize the integral input-to-state stability
property and guarantees the state of the switched system to
converge to zero under the action of disturbances with "bounded
energy". The main feature of the analysis is that it does not rely
on the property for the switching to stop in finite time. The two
important cases of locally exponentially stable and feedforward
systems are analyzed in detail.

<br> The problem of residual generation for fault detection and isolation
in the presence of measurement noise for a class of non-linear
systems is considered. Exploiting the tools and the results of the
geometric approach to the problem of residual generation, a method
is proposed for the design of a filter which attenuates the effect
of the measurement noise on the residual in the case in which the
effect of the fault on the residual is minimal.

We present in this paper a differential-geometric approach
to the problem of fault detection and isolation for nonlinear
systems. A necessary condition for the problem to be solvable is
derived in terms of an unobservability distribution, which is com-putable
by means of suitable algorithms. The existence and regularity
of such a distribution implies the existence of changes of
coordinates in the state and in the output space which induce an
“observable” quotient subsystem unaffected by all fault signals but
one. For this subsystem, a fault detection filter is designed.

The purpose of this note is to introduce the notion of observability codistribution for a
nonlinear system, which extends the (dual of the) notion of "unobservability sub-

number of properties which render the notion of unobservability subspace powerful
in the solution of certain design problems.</p>

We discuss the problem of semi-globally asymptotically stabilizing
general nonlinear discrete-time systems in the presence of data-rate
constraints under the stabilizability assumption only. The proposed
solution relies on a simple result on asymptotic estimation for
nonlinear systems under data-rate constraints, which holds for
trajectories confined within a known bounded region of the state
space. To render the region actually invariant, the data rate must
be suitably chosen. The data rate needed to achieve the
stabilization goal is shown to depend on the size of the set of
initial conditions only.

In this paper we aim to describe the propagation
of a "failure event" through a metabolic network
(i.e. no formation of a set of metabolites) and,
by means of a Markov chain, to be able to compute the long-run failure probability of each
metabolite following a transient random failure event occurring
somewhere in the network. Moreover, we
will introduce and motivate the definition of a "tolerance index" for each metabolite.
The <em>in silico</em>
analysis reveals that in most of the 142 organisms'
metabolic network we considered, such tolerance index
is approximately uniformly distributed among
nodes with the same in-degree, while the failure distribution
and the connection degree is not. A list
of metabolites ranked by failure probability and tolerance
index for all the 142 organism is also provided in the <a href="http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~farina/robustness/">

The problem of asymptotic stabilization under input
constraints in the case in which feedback information is sent through a
communication channel is studied. The process to control is
comprised of a chain of integrators cascaded to a zero dynamics. A
solution is given which provides encoder, decoder and controller
accomplishing asymptotic stabilization of the closed-loop system
while fulfilling the constraints. The communication channel
has finite bandwidth, transmission delay and
adaptive transmission rate.
The result is given for a variety of cases which include
state and output feedback,
ISS and integral ISS zero dynamics.
The number of bits used to encode the
information generated by the process and which is needed to the purpose
of stabilizing the process is explicitly assessed.

Monitoring large-scale systems is of
fundamental importance in modern infrastructures. Many of these
large-scale systems are complex interconnections of sub-components
which interact by means of communication channel with limited
bandwidth. Therefore the information must be encoded in order to
be transmitted. Given a class of encoders, we study the problem of
detecting faults affecting some of these  sub-components starting
from the encoded information, and precisely characterize a class
of faults which can be detected.

We present some results on the problem of supervisory regulation of systems
with input constraints. We consider the case in which the process to control is
unknown but belongs to a family of linear systems which are Lyapunov stable (not
necessarily asymptotically stable). The aim is to design a supervisory control system
which guarantees the state of the plant to converge asymptotically to zero.
