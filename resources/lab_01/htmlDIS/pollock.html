<P><FONT COLOR="#191970">OSCAR is an architecture for a rational agent based upon an
evolving philosophical theory of rational cognition.  Philosophers
distinguish between epistemic cognition, which is cognition about what to
believe, and practical cognition, which is cognition about what to do.  We
can think of the latter as including goal selection, plan construction,
plan selection, and plan execution.  A system of defeasible reasoning
provides the inference-engine for epistemic cognition.  This system of
defeasible reasoning has been used to formulate and implement theories of
reasoning from perception, certain aspects of temporal reasoning, causal
reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, and a solution to the frame problem.
	Despite important logical differences between epistemic and
practical cognition, most of the work of practical cognition is carried out
by epistemic cognition.  Rather than running a dedicated planner, OSCAR
constructs plans by performing epistemic reasoning about the results of
performing actions.  It is argued that in an agent capable of sophisticated
epistemic cognition, the search for threats in plans ceases to be
computable, and planning must be done defeasibly rather than by running a
familiar-looking planning algorithm.
	The integration of epistemic and practical cognition in OSCAR
generates a problem concerning when to stop reasoning and start acting.  A
solution will be proposed that turns upon some subtle features of OSCAR's
defeasible reasoning.</FONT></P>
