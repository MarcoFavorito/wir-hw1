Multivalued logics have a long tradition in the philosophy and logic literature
that originates from the work by _Lukaszewicz in the 20's. More recently, many
AI researchers have been interested in this topic for both semantic and
computational reasons. Multivalued logics have indeed been frequently used
both for their semantic properties and as tools for designing tractable
reasoning systems. We focus here on the computational aspects of multivalued
logics. The main result of this paper is a detailed picture of the impact that
the semantic definition, the syntactic form and the assumptions on the relative
sizes of the inputs have on the complexity of entailment checking. In particular
we show new polynomial cases and generalize polynomial cases already known
in the literature for various popular multivalued logics. Such polynomial cases
are obtained by means of two simple algorithms, sharing a common method.
