                   formalisms  and  belief  revision  operators  have  been  introduced
                   as useful tools to describe and reason about evolving scenarios.<p>
                   Both approaches have been proven effective in a number of different situations. However, little is known about their relationship.<p>
                   Previous work by Winslett has shown some correlations between
                   a specific operator and circumscription. In this paper we greatly
                   extend Winslett's work by establishing new relations between circumscription and a large number of belief revision operators. This
                   highlights similarities and differences between these formalisms.<p>
                   Furthermore, these connections provide us with the possibility of
                   importing results in one field into the other one.<p>
