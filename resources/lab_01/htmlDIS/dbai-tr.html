<h1>Enhancing answer set planning</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
Answer set planning is an important application of Disjunctive Logic
Programming (DLP).  In answer set planning, a planning problem P is encoded
in a DLP program LP, such that each answer set of LP corresponds to a
solution of the planning problem P (i.e., to a valid plan).  So far, answer
set planning has been used only to encode classical planning problems under
<em>complete</em> (certain) initial state. Even though the research
community was interested in encoding harder planning problems in DLP, so
far no encoding was provided: the way how planning under incomplete
information should be encoded in DLP was obscure.  In this paper, we show a
technique which allows us to encode in DLP (under the answer sets
semantics) two important classes of planning problems, namely,
<em>conformant planning</em> and <em> conditional planning</em>.  Both
problems deal with planning under incomplete (or uncertain) initial state,
i.e., the initial truth value of a number of fluents is unknown.  Both
problems are hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, even if
the length of the required plan is polynomially bounded. We report also
some preliminary results of experiments, which are very encouraging on the
use of our techniques.
