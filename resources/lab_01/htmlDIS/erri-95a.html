In this paper we present a general framework for representing agents in



interactive systems. We propose it as a basic tool for modelling students
within Intelligent Tutoring Systems. This framework turns out to be very
suited for applications where the perceptions of the system about users are
taken into account in order to make the interaction more effective and
individualized, on the basis of their needs and characteristics. Appealing to
the situation calculus, we present a general classification of the knowledge
involved in the process of modelling agents, in particular students of Intelligent
Tutoring Systems. Then, we discuss the various representational issues
introduced and provide a formal semantics. The framework presented is very
general in that it can represent various kinds of Adaptive Interactive Systems
and is able to cope with the multi-agent case.
