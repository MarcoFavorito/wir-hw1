<H1>TINO's experiments with sensing actions</H1>
</CENTER>

<HR> 

<P> 
These are two experiments in which the robot performs sensing
actions to verify whether a door is open. 
Sensing actions do not change the state of the robot in the
environment, but affect the robot's knowledge about the
environment.
In this examples the initial state of the robot does not contain 
any information about doors. The planning system is able to generate 
a conditional plan involving sensing actions.
When the plan is executed,
the additive knowledge coming from results of sensing
actions is used to decide which actions are to be 
executed in order to reach the room.
