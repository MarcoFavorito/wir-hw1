<H1>Embedding negation as failure into minimal knowledge</H1>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>Recent studies in nonmonotonic reasoning have shown that many of the best
known nonmonotonic logics are based on the same two fundamental principles,
i.e. minimal knowledge and negation as failure (or negation by default).
In this paper we prove that it is possible to express negation as failure
in terms of minimal knowledge.  Specifically, we present a polynomial,
non-faithful, modular embedding of Lifschitz's logic of minimal knowledge
and negation as failure MKNF into Halpern and Moses' logic of minimal
knowledge S5G. From the theoretical viewpoint, this result implies
that minimal knowledge has the same expressive power of negation as
failure, hence it is possible to embed all the best known propositional
nonmonotonic formalisms, in particular default logic, autoepistemic logic,
and circumscription, into S5G.  From the perspective of
knowledge-based systems, the proposed embedding allows in principle for
realizing negation as failure in systems without a negation as failure
construct, as e.g. positive disjunctive deductive databases. </P>
