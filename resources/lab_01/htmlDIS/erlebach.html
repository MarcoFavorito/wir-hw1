<br>
A disk graph is the intersection graph of a set of disks with arbitrary
diameters in the plane.  For the case that the disk representation is given, we
present polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTASs) for the maximum weight
independent set problem (selecting disjoint disks of maximum total weight) and
for the minimum weight vertex cover problem in disk graphs.  These are the
first known PTASs for NP-hard optimization problems on disk graphs.
They are based on a novel recursive subdivision of the plane that allows
applying a shifting strategy on different levels simultaneously, so that a
dynamic programming approach becomes feasible.  The PTASs for disk graphs
represent a common generalization of previous results for planar graphs and
unit disk graphs. They can be extended to intersection graphs of other
"disk-like" geometric objects (such as squares or regular polygons),
also in higher dimensions.
