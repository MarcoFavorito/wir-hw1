<H2><font color=purple><i>History of ICDT</i></font></H2>
<p>
ICDT  is a biennial
international  conference on theoretical aspects of databases 
and a forum for communicating research advances on the principles 
of database systems. 
ICDT had its origins in the Theoretical Issues in Databases (TIDB) workshops
in Cetraro (Italy) and Benodet (France) in the early 1980's.
The first  ICDT conference was held in Rome 1986. Subsequent
conferences were held in Bruges (1988), Paris
(1990), Berlin (1992),  Prague (1995), Delphi (1997),
Jerusalem (1999), and London (2001).
A parallel development in the former Eastern Bloc, was the establishment of 
the biennial Symposium on Mathematical Fundamentals of Database Systems
(MFDBS).
The first MFDBS took place in  Dresden 1987; subsequent symposia were
held in  Visegrad (1989) and Rostock
(1991).
In 1992 ICDT merged 
with MFDBS, to create a single biennial conference serving the
European and international 
communities of database theoreticians.
<p>



ICDT is a European event. However, from the start, there was a substantial
involvement of the international community, reflected in the programme
committees, the papers presented and the participants. ICDT is now a truly
international conference, attracting papers and participants from all over
the world, and attended by the leading researchers of database theory.

<p> As a European event, ICDT is traditionally held in a historic
European city.  ICDT 2003 will be held in Siena, Italy.

<H2><font color=purple><i>The ICDT Council</i></font></H2>
<p>
In 1998, an international body, the ICDT Council, was formed. Its
tasks include various aspects of sponsoring and encouraging research
in database theory and related fields in Europe. Of primary importance among
these tasks is the organization of the ICDT.
The Council works in cooperation with EDBT (Extending Database
technology), the European organization
for database research that is responsible for the organization of the
biennial conference EDBT.
