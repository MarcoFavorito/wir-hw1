<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
<br>
Consider a version of the game ``Twenty Questions'' played on the set
{1,...,N} where the player giving answers may lie in her answers.  For some
fixed and previously known fraction r, the questioner will make Q questions
(he must announce his chosen value of Q in advance) and the responder may
lie in up to rQ of the answers.  It is not obvious that there is any Q(N,r)
allowing the questioner to win, even with r < 1/100000 (the reader should
try to find a strategy, even with 2^N/r questions).  The talk will solve
this problem and will connect it to related problems.
