for Parallel Operating Systems:</H3>

<P>We have long-term research cooperations with the German company Parsytec
GmbH based on our expertise in parallel algorithms, the operation of parallel
computers and the design of optimised parallel architectures. These successful
efforts, partly supported by the ALCOM II project, represent a good basis
for ALCOM-IT . The work in the field of process mapping will be expanded
from the mapping of static process graphs to the mapping of dynamic process
graphs and process migration. New algorithms will be designed, implemented
and integrated in the next release of PARIX, the operating system of Parsytec.
The ``virtual topology library'' integrated in the current PARIX releases
has shown that such cooperation works very successfully. </P>

<UL>
<P><IMG SRC="../images/new.gif" HSPACE=2 BORDER=1 HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=28>In
our first project plan it was foreseen that the results of workpackage
4.1. will be exploited by Parsytec. At that time Parsytec had plans to
integrate sophisticated methods for load balancing and distributed shared
memory simulation into their operating system Parix. Due to the new market
orientation of Parsytec, which now focusses on embedded parallel computing
systems in vision applications, the company is no longer interested in
extending the Parix operating system. Therefore Parsytec will not exploit
the results of workpackage 4.1.<BR>
Independently from our cooperation with Parsytec we have since about one
year a dose cooperation with the Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG
which is also located in Paderborn. This cooperation focusses on the joint
development of a closely coupled workstation cluster using SCI- Interfaces
provided by Dolphin Interconnect Solutions. The SCI cluster is assembled
by SNI and the basic message passing interface is implemented by the University
of Paderborn. The Daisy-library developed in workpackage 4.1 (Parallel
Operating Systems) of the ALCOM-IT project integrates the simulation of
shared memory and loadbalancing techniques for the efficient use of parallel
and distributed systems. Using the special features of the SCI communication
architecture (global address space and one-sided communication) it will
be possible to implement these services very efficiently on the SCI cluster.
The adaptation of Daisy to the cluster system, which Will be done in 1998,
will lead to a system which aids the exploitation of the enhanced computation
and communication capabilities of SCI technologies.</P>
</UL>

<P>We shall also provide algorithmic strategies for the realisation of
global variables in distributed memory machines. Here we combine the advantages
of hashing and caching strategies: hashing reduces congestion, i.e., ensures
that no hot spots occur, caching tries to maintain data locality. Some
of these methods have been already successfully implemented in a library
of basic services, and integrated in OCCAM-light, an extension of the parallel
language OCCAM. The development of these parallel algorithms will be supported
by performance modeling. A sufficiently detailed abstract model of the
parallel architecture will be specified. The model provides the implemented
algorithms with their architecture dependent parameters. This work will
also support the design of new parallel architectures. </P>
