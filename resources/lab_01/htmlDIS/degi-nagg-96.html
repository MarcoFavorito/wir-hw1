In this paper we present a conceptual data model, called SDM , which is able
to represent both elementary and statistical data at a conceptual level. SDM
borrows several elements from both research in Object Oriented Databases
and research in Knowledge Representation. In addition it is equipped with
suitable mechanisms to form classes of individuals by classifying the instances
of a target class according to some specified criteria. Notably, the class
resulting from such a statistical aggregation can then be treated exactly as a
class of elementary data. This ability fulfills the often perceived necessity, in
modeling real domains, of treating statistical aggregates and elementary data
in an homogeneous way.
