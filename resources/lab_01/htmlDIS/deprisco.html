<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
<br>
With the Internet reaching increasingly more people, the amount of traffic
delivered across the network can cause congestion and consequently bad 
performance. Centralized control of a web site poses serious limitations to
the now worldwide audience of web sites. Bottlenecks include the first
mile, that is the connection between the web server and its entry point
to the Internet, peering points, where Internet Service Providers
exchange traffic, backbones, used to carry traffic within each network,
and the last mile, that is the connection between the end user and its
entry point to the Internet.  Flash crowds are also a big problem for web
content providers. If demand overflows the servers' capacity the site crashes.

<br>Akamai provides a clever web content delivery service by moving the content from
centralized web sites to a massive distributed network with servers on
the "edge" of the Internet. The "edge" of the Internet are those locations
close to the end users. Using intelligent Domain Name Resolution and caching,
and balancing the load over the entire network, Akamai is able to deliver web
content faster and more reliably.
 
<br>In this talk we will explain the Akamai way of delivering web content.
