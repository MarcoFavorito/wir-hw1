Both in Knowledge Representation and in Databases representation
formalisms have been developed which offer powerful structuring capabilities
and procedures to reason on a specification. However, while in Databases the
common assumption is that the modeled domain is finite, this has seldom been
an issue in Description Logics. For the simpler logics, reasoning with respect
to finite models amounts to reasoning with respect to arbitrary ones, but
finiteness of the domain needs to be considered if expressivity is increased and
the finite model property fails. Procedures for reasoning with respect to
arbitrary models in very expressive Description Logics have been developed,
but these are not directly applicable in the finite case. We show that we can
nevertheless capture a restricted form of finiteness and represent finite
modeling structures such as lists and trees, while still reasoning with respect
to arbitrary models. The assumption of finiteness of the domain is essential,
however, to capture several data models used in Databases. Finite model
reasoning is not so well investigated and decidability is open for many
important cases. The main result of this paper is a procedure to reason with
respect to finite models in an expressive Description Logic equipped with
inverse roles, cardinality constraints, and in which arbitrary inclusions between
concepts can be specified without any restriction. This provides the necessary
expressivity to go beyond most semantic and object-oriented Database models,



and capture several useful extensions.
