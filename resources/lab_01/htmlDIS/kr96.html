<H1> Moving a Robot: the KR&ampR Approach at Work </H1>

<H2> Abstract </H2>

We describe an approach to reasoning about actions and plan generation
within the framework of description logics.  From an epistemological
viewpoint, our approach is based on the formalization of actions given by
dynamic logics, but we exploit their correspondence with description logics
to turn the formalization into an actual implementation. In particular, we
are able to carefully weaken the logical inference process, thus making the
reasoning of the robot computationally feasible.  From a practical
viewpoint, we use a general purpose knowledge representation environment
based on description logics, and its associated reasoning tools, in order
to plan the actions of the mobile robot "Tino", starting from the knowledge
about the environment and the action specification.  The robot's reactive
capabilities allow it to execute such plans in the real world.
