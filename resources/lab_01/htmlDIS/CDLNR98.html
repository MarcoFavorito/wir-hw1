In recent years there has been a growing interest in accessing, relating, and
combining data from multiple sources. Indeed, Information Integration is one
of the core problems in distributed databases, cooperative information
systems, and data warehousing, which are key areas in the software
development industry. Two critical factors for the design and maintenance of
applications requiring Information Integration are conceptual modeling of the
domain, and reasoning support over the conceptual representation. We
demonstrate that Knowledge Representation and Reasoning techniques can
play an important role for both of these factors, by proposing a Description
Logic based framework for Information Integration. We show that the
development of successful Information Integration solutions requires not only
to resort to very expressive Description Logics, but also to significantly extend
them. We present a novel approach to conceptual modeling for Information
Integration, which allows for suitably modeling the global concepts of the
application, the individual information sources, and the constraints among
different sources. Moreover, we devise inference procedures for the
fundamental reasoning services, namely relation and concept subsumption,
and query containment. Finally, we present a methodological framework for
Information Integration, which can be applied in several contexts, and
highlights the role of reasoning services within the design process.
