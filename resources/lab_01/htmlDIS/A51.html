  We propose an approach for the integration of abduction and induction in
  Logic Programming. In particular, we show how it is possible to learn an
  abductive logic program starting from an abductive background knowledge
  and a set of examples. By integrating Inductive Logic Programming with
  Abductive Logic Programming we can learn in presence of incomplete
  knowledge. Incomplete knowledge is handled by designating some pieces of
  information as abducibles, that is, possible hypotheses which can be
  assumed, provided that they are consistent with the current knowledge base.
  We then specialize the framework for FOIL, an ILP system adopting
  extensional coverage. In particular, we propose an extension of the FOIL
  algorithm that is able to learn from incomplete data.
