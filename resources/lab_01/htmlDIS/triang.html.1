<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

Triangulation in stereo analysis is the task of 
computing the 3D position of points in the images, given
the disparity map and the geometry of the stereo setting.


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>2. Camera Model</H2>

<P>
The pinhole camera model is often used for 3D reconstruction.

<P>
The relation between the world coordinates of
a point P(X,Y,Z) and the coordinates on the image plane (x,y) in a
pinhole camera is
<P>x = f * X / Z</P>
<P>y = f * Y / Z</P>
where f is the focal distance of the lens.


<H3>2.1 From frame to image coordinates</H2>

<P>
A digitalized image is usually stored in a frame buffer, that can be seen as
a matrix of pixels with W columns and H rows.
Let (i,j) be the discrete frame coordinates of the image with origin in the
upperleft corner, (Ox,Oy) be the focal point of the lens (the intersection
between the optical axes and the image plane) in the frame coordinates, 
and (x,y) be the image coordinates.<BR>


<P><IMG SRC="fig/image-coords.gif" ALT="Camera Coordinates" ALIGN=NONE></P>

<P>
Image coordinates relate to frame coordinates in the following way:
<P>x = ( i - Ox ) * Sx</P>
<P>y = ( j - Oy ) * Sy</P>
where Sx,Sy are the horizontal and vertical distances of two adjacent pixels
in the frame buffer.


<H3>2.2 Radial distortion</H3>

Lens distortion can be modelled by the following equations:

<P>x = xd * ( 1 + k1 * rd^2 )</P>
<P>y = yd * ( 1 + k1 * rd^2 )</P>

where (xd,yd) are the image coordinates of the distorted image, 
rd = SQRT(xd^2 + yd^2), and k1 is a constant depending on the distortion of the lens.

<P>
The relation between image and frame coordinates in presence of lens distortion is:

<P>x = ( id - Ox ) * Sx * ( 1 + k1 * rd^2 )</P>
<P>y = ( jd - Oy ) * Sy * ( 1 + k1 * rd^2 )</P>



<H3>2.3 Scanning and sampling</H3>

<P>
If the distances of two adjacent cells in the camera digitalization device
are known (Px,Py), then the distances of pixels in the image are

<P>Sx = ax * Px</P>
<P>Sy = Py</P>

where ax is a scale factor due to the displacement in horizontal scanning and sampling
frequencies. On the contrary, there is no displacement in vertical sampling.



<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H2>3. Triangulation</H2>

The 3D position (X,Y,Z) of a point P, can be reconstructed from
the perspective projection of P on the image planes of the cameras,
once the relative position and orientation of the two cameras are known.

<P>
We choose the 3D world reference system to be the left camera reference system.
The right camera is translated and rotated with respect from the left one,
therefore six parameters describe this transformation.<BR>

The simplest case arise when the optical axes of two cameras are parallel, and
the translation of the right camera is only along the X axis.

<H3>4.1 Geometry for parallel cameras</H3>

<P>
Let us consider the optical setting in the figure, that is also called
<I>standard model</I>.
<OL>
<LI>L and R are two pinhole cameras with parallel optical axes. Let f be the focal length
of both cameras.
<LI>The baseline (that is the line connecting the two lens centers) 
is perpendicular to the optical axes. Let b be the distance between the two lens centers.
<LI>XZ is the plane where the optical axes lie,
XY plane is parallel to the image plane of both cameras,
X axis equals the baseline and
the origin O of (X,Y,Z) world reference system is the lens center of the left camera.
</OL>

<P><IMG SRC="fig/triang.gif" ALT="Stereo Triangulation" ALIGN=NONE></P>

<P>
In this setting the equations of stereo triangulation are:
<P>Z = ( b * f ) / ( x1 - x2 )</P>
<P>X = x1 * Z / f  </P>
<P>Y = y1 * Z / f  </P>


<H3>4.2 Non-parallel cameras</H3>

In the general case, the right camera can be rotated with respect to the left one
in three directions. In all this section we assume that
rotation angles are small (<I>small angle approximation</I>).

<P><B>Rotation around Y axis (<I>theta</I>)</B></P>

In this case the optical axes are not parallel, but they both lie on the XZ plane,
so they intersect in a point (0,0,Z0), that is called <I>fixation point</I> and
could also be behind the cameras (Z0<0).<BR>
If <I>theta</I> is the rotation angle, then Z0 = b / tan(<I>theta</I>).

<P>
Under small angle approximation, we can still assume the right image plane
to be parallel to the left image plane and hence to XY plane.

<P><IMG SRC="fig/triang-np.gif" ALT="Non Parallel Stereo Triangulation" ALIGN=NONE></P>

<P>
In this case we have:
<P>Z = ( b * f ) / ( x1 - x2 + f * b / Z0 )</P>
<P>X = x1 * Z / f </P>
<P>Y = y1 * Z / f </P>


<P><B>Rotation around X axis (<I>phi</I>)</B></P>

<P>
Rotation around X axis only affects the Y coordinate in reconstruction.
Let <I>phi</I> be the rotation angle, then stereo triangulation is
<P>Z = ( b * f ) / ( x1 - x2 )</P>
<P>X = x1 * Z / f </P>
<P>Y = y1 * Z / f  +  tan(<I>phi</I>) * Z </P>


<P><B>Rotation around Z axis (<I>psi</I>)</B></P>

<P>
Rotation around optical axis is usually dealt with by rotating the image
before applying matching and triangulation.<BR>
In the following the rotation angle of the right camera around its optical axis
will be called <I>psi</I>.


<H3>4.3 General case</H3>

Given the translation vector T and rotation matrix R describing the transormation
from left camera to right camera coordinates, the equation to solve for
stereo triangulation is
<P>p' = RT ( p - T )</P>
where p and p' are the coordinates of P in the left and right camera coordinates
respectively, and RT is the transpose (or the inverse) matrix of R.
