In all cases, there is<br>    assumption that the customer does not have any choice to leave the<br>    network; his only concern is the QoS. The competitive wireless<br>    network brings different perspective as customers can leave the<br>    network, in case he is not satisfied with the provider and join<br>    another provider. With number portability in place, this has become <br>    more easy for the user. In this work, we attempt to use the<br>    Non-cooperative Game Theory based algorithm, to manage the resources<br>    in a CDMA network. The resource management is implemented in two<br>    steps, macro-level Admission Control and micro-level flow control.<br>    The uniqueness of this work is its application of customer<br>    Churn-rate in the resource management. Customer Churn-rate includes<br>    the uncertainty created by the competition as well as the<br>    differences of the customer's reaction to provider's resource<br>    management methods. Our simulation results show that the provider<br>    can improve their net revenue by using this algorithm compared to<br>    the traditional resource management techniques.<br>  <p><br>    <a href=http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/sia> <img SRC="http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/sia/logo.gif" ALT="SIA" height=57 width=100></a>     &nbsp; <BR>    &nbsp; <BR>    &nbsp; <BR>    &nbsp;</P></DL>
