Belief integration methods are often aimed at deriving a single
and consistent knowledge base that retains as much as possible of
the knowledge bases to integrate.   The rationale behind this
approach is the minimal change principle:   the result of the
integration process should differ as less as possible from the
knowledge bases to integrate.   We show that this principle can be
reformulated in terms of a more general model of belief revision,
based on the assumption that inconsistency is due to the mistakes
the knowledge bases contain.   Current belief revision strategies
are based on a specific kind of mistakes, which however does not
include all possible ones.   Some alternative possibilities are
discussed.
