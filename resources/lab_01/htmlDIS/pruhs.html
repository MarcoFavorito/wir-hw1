<br>
I will discuss server scheduling policies to minimize user perceived latency
in client-server systems where the server uses broadcast/multicast 
communication.  This a fundamental problem because:

<br>
* Client-server systems (e.g. web servers, name servers, database
servers, etc.)  are ubiquitous in networking applications.

<br>
* Broadcasting/Multicasting is a basic form of communication.
In wireless networks, nature generally imposes broadcast
communication at the physical layer.
In wired networks, multi-casting is the obvious solution 
to many scalability problems. While IP multi-cast
has not gained widespread acceptance, some form of multi-cast
(perhaps at the application level) will almost certainly
become accepted in the not too distant future.

*Average user perceived latency is the mostly commonly used measure
of systems performance.

This talk will contain material from the following papers
