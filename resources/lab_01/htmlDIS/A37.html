  A computational approach to the simulation of cognitive models of
  conceptual change in children learning elementary physics is presented . The
  student's mental model is inferred from a sequence of interviews collected
  along a period of eleven teaching sessions. Goal of the simulation is to
  support the cognitive scientist's investigation of learning in humans. The
  hypothesized cognitive models are based on a theory of conceptual change,
  derived from psichology results and educational experiences, which accounts
  for the evolution of the student's knowledge over a learning period. A
  Machine Learning (ML) system, able to handle domain knowledge
  (including a causal model of the domain), has been chosen as tool for the
  simulation of the cognitive models evolution. The system performs
  knowledge revision and provides causal explanation for its conclusions.
