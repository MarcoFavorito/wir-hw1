<h3><a NAME="Chapter01">Chapter 1: An Introduction to Description
Logics</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Daniele Nardi, Ronald J. Brachmann</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

This Introduction presents the main motivations for the development of
Description Logics (DL) as a formalism for representing knowledge, as well as
some important basic notions underlying all systems that have been created in
the DL tradition. In addition, we provide the reader with an overview of the
entire book and some guidelines for reading it. We first address the
relationship between Description Logics and earlier semantic network and frame
systems, which represent the original heritage of the field. We delve into some
of the key problems encountered with the older efforts. Subsequently, we
introduce the basic features of Description Logic languages and related
reasoning techniques. Description Logic languages are then viewed as the core
of knowledge representation systems, considering both the structure of a DL
knowledge base and its associated reasoning services. The development of some
implemented knowledge representation systems based on Description Logics and
the rst applications built with such systems are then reviewed. Finally, we
address the relationship of Description Logics to other fields of Computer
Science. We also discuss some extensions of the basic representation language
machinery; these include features proposed for incorporation in the formalism
that originally arose in implemented systems, and features proposed to cope
with the needs of certain application domains.

<h2><a NAME="Part1"></a>PART I: THEORY</h2>

<h3><a NAME="Chapter02">Chapter 2: Basic Description Logics</h3></a>

Authors: <b>Franz Baader, Werner Nutt</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

This chapter provides an introduction to Description Logics as a formal
language for representing knowledge and reasoning about it.  It first gives a
short overview of the ideas underlying Description Logics.  Then it introduces
syntax and semantics, covering the basic constructors that are used in systems
or have been introduced in the literature, and the way these constructors can
be used to build knowledge bases.  Finally, it defines the typical inference
problems, shows how they are interrelated, and describes different approaches
for effectively solving these problems.  Some of the topics that are only
briefly mentioned in this chapter will be treated in more detail in subsequent
chapters.

<h3><a NAME="Chapter03">Chapter 3: Complexity of Reasoning</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Francesco M. Donini</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

We present lower bounds on the computational complexity of satisfiability and
subsumption in several description logics.  We interpret these lower bounds as
coming from different ``sources of complexity'', which we isolate one by one.
We consider both reasoning with simple concept expressions and with an
underlying TBox.  We discuss also complexity of instance check in simple
ABoxes.  We tried to enhance clarity and ease of presentation, sometimes
sacrificing exhaustiveness for lack of space.


<h3><a NAME="Chapter04">Chapter 4: Relationships with Other Formalisms</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Ulrike Sattler, Diego Calvanese, Ralf Molitor</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

In this chapter, we are concerned with the relationship between description
logics and other formalisms, regardless of whether they were designed for
knowledge representation issues or not. Obviously, due to the lack of space, we
cannot compare each representational formalism with description logics, thus we
concentrated on those that either (1) had or have a strong influence on
description logics (e.g., modal logics), (2) are closely related to description
logics for historical reasons (e.g., semantic networks and structured
inheritance networks), (3) have similar expressive power (e.g., semantic data
models).  There are far more knowledge representation formalisms than those
mentioned in this section. For example, ``verb-centered'' graphical formalisms
like those introduced by [Simm73] are not mentioned since we believe that their
relationship with description logics is too weak.

<h3><a NAME="Chapter05">Chapter 5: Expressive Description Logics</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Giuseppe De Giacomo, Diego Calvanese</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

This chapter covers extensions of the basic description logics introduced in
Chapter 2 by very expressive constructs that require advanced reasoning
techniques.  In particular, we study reasoning in description logics that
include general inclusion axioms, inverse roles, number-restrictions,
reflexive-transitive closure of roles, fixpoint constructs for recursive
definitions, and relations of arbitrary arity. The chapter will also address
reasoning w.r.t. knowledge bases including both a TBox and an ABox, and discuss
more general ways to treat objects.  Since the logics considered in the chapter
lack the finite model property, finite model reasoning is of interest and will
also be discussed.  Finally, we mention several extensions to description
logics that lead to undecidability, confirming that the expressive description
logics considered in this chapter are close to the boundary between
decidability and undecidability.

<h3><a NAME="Chapter06">Chapter 6: Extensions to Description Logics</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Franz Baader, Ralph Kuesters, Frank Wolter</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

This chapter considers, on the one hand, extensions of Description Logics by
features not available in the basic framework, but considered important for
using Description Logics as a modeling language.  In particular, it addresses
the extensions concerning: concrete domain constraints; modal, epistemic, and
temporal operators; probabilities and fuzzy logic; and defaults.  On the other
hand, it considers non-standard inference problems for Description Logics,
i.e., inference problems that--unlike subsumption or instance checking--are
not available in all systems, but have turned out to be useful in
applications. In particular, it addresses the non-standard inference problems:
least common subsumer and most specific concept; unification and matching of
concepts; and rewriting.

<h3><a NAME="Chapter07">Chapter 7: From Description Logics Provers to Knowledge
Representation Systems</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Deborah L. McGuinness, Peter Patel-Schneider</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

A description-logic based knowledge representation system is more than an
inference engine for a particular description logic.  A knowledge
representation system must provide a number of services to human users,
including presentation of the information stored in the system in a manner
palatable to users and justification of the inferences performed by the system.
If human users cannot understand what the system is doing, then the development
of knowledge bases is made much more difficult or even impossible.  A knowledge
representation system must also provide a number of services to application
programs, including access to the basic information stored in the system but
also including access to the machinations of the system.  If programs cannot
easily access and manipulate the information stored in the system, then the
development of applications is made much more difficult or even impossible.

<h3><a NAME="Chapter08">Chapter 8: Description Logic Systems</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Ralf Moeller, Volker Haarslev</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

This chapter discusses implemented description logic systems that have played
or play an important role in the field. It first presents several earlier
systems that, although not based on description logics, have provided important
ideas. These systems include KlOne, Krypton, Nikl, and Kandor. Then, successor
systems are described by classifying them along the characteristics discussed
in the previous chapters, addressing the following systems: Classic (``almost''
complete, fast); Back, Loom (expressive, incomplete); Kris, Crack (expressive,
complete). At last, new optimized generation of very expressive but sound and
complete DL systems is also introduced. In particular, we focus on the systems
DLP, Fact, and Racer and explain what they can and cannot do.

<h3><a NAME="Chapters09">Chapter 9: Implementation and Optimization
Techniques</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Ian Horrocks</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

This chapter will discuss the implementation of the reasoning services which
form the core of Description Logic based Knowledge Representation Systems.  To
be useful in realistic applications, such systems need both expressive logics
and fast reasoners. As expressive logics inevitably have high worst-case
complexities, this can only be achieved by employing highly optimised
implementations of suitable reasoning algorithms.  Systems based on such
implementations have demonstrated that they can perform well with problems that
occur in realistic applications, including problems where unoptimised reasoning
is hopelessly intractable.

<h3><a NAME="Chapter10">Chapter 10: Conceptual Modeling with Description
Logics</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Alex Borgida, Ronald J. Brachman</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

The purpose of the chapter is to help someone familiar with DLs to understand
the issues involved in developing an ontology for some universe of discourse,
which is to become a conceptual model or knowledge base represented and
reasoned with using Description Logics.  We briefly review the purposes and
history of conceptual modeling, and then use the domain of a university library
to illustrate an approach to conceptual modeling that combines general ideas of
object-centered modeling with a look at special modeling/ontological problems,
and DL-specific solutions to them.  Among the ontological issues considered are
the nature of individuals, concept specialization, non-binary relationships,
materialization, aspects of part-whole relationships, and epistemic aspects of
individual knowledge.

<h3><a NAME="Chapter11">Chapter 11: Software Engineering</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Christopher A. Welty</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

One of the first large applications of description logics was in the area of
software engineering.  In software, programmers and maintainers of large
systems are plagued with information overload.  These systems are typically
over a million lines of code, some approach fifty million.  The size of the
workforce dedicated to maintaining these enormous systems is often over a
thousand.  In addition, turnover is quite high, as is the training investment
required to make someone a productive member of the team.  This seems, on the
surface, to be a problem crying out for a knowledge-based solution, but
understanding precisely how description logics can play a role requires
understanding the basic problems of software engineering ``in the large.''

<h3><a NAME="Chapter12">Chapter 12: Description Logic for
Configuration</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Deborah L. McGuinness</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

Description logics are used to solve a wide variety of problems with
configuration applications being some of the largest and longest-lived.  There
is concrete, commercial evidence that shows that description logic-based
configurators have been successfully fielded for over a decade.  Additionally,
it appears that configuration applications have a number of characteristics
that make them well-suited to description logic-based solutions.  This chapter
will introduce the problem of configuration, describe some requirements of
configuration applications that make them candidates for description
logic-based solutions, show examples of these requirements in a configuration
example, and introduce the largest and longest lived family of description
logic-based configurators.


<h3><a NAME="Chapter13">Chapter 13: Description Logics in Medical
Informatics</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Alan Rector</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

Description logics and related formalisms are being applied in at least five
applications in medical informatics---terminology, intelligent user interfaces,
decision support and semantic indexing, language technology, and systems
integration.  Important issues include size, complexity, connectivity, and the
wide range of granularity required---medical terminologies require on the order
of 250,000 concepts, some involving a dozen or more conjuncts with deep
nesting; the nature of anatomy and physiology is that everything connects to
everything else; and notions to be represented range from psychology to
molecular biology.  Technical issues for expressivity have focused on problems
of part-whole relations and the need to provide ``frame-like''
functionality---i.e., the ability to determine efficiently what can sensibly be
said about any particular concept and means of handling at least limited cases
of defaults with exceptions.  There are also significant problems with
``semantic normalisation'' and ``clinical pragmatics'' because understanding
medical notions often depends on implicit knowledge and some notions defy easy
logical formulation.  The two best known efforts---OpenGALEN and
SNOMED-RT---both use idiosyncratic description logics with generally limited
expressivity but specialised extensions to cope with issues around part-whole
and other transitive relations.  There is also a conflict between the needs for
re-use and the requirement for easy understandability by domain expert authors.
OpenGALEN has coped with this conflict by introducing a layered architecture
with a high level ``Intermediate Representation'' which insulates authors from
the details of the description logic which is treated as an ``assembly
language'' rather than the primary medium for expressing the ontology.


<h3><a NAME="Chapter14">Chapter 14: Digital Libraries and Web Based
Information Systems</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Ian Horrocks, Deborah L. McGuinness, Christopher A. Welty</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

It has long been realised that the web could benefit from having its content
understandable and available in a machine processable form, and it is widely
agreed that ontologies will play a key role in providing much enabling
infrastructure to support this goal. In this chapter we review briefly a
selected history of description logics in web-based information systems, and
the more recent developments related to OIL, DAML+OIL and the semantic web. OIL
and DAML+OIL are ontology languages specifically designed for use on the web;
they exploit existing web standards (XML, RDF and RDFS), adding the formal
rigor of a description logic and the ontological primitives of object oriented
and frame based systems. 

<h3><a NAME="Chapter15">Chapter 15: Natural Language Processing</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Enrico Franconi</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

In most natural language processing applications, Description Logics have been
used to encode in a knowledge base some syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic
elements needed to drive the semantic interpretation and the natural language
generation processes. More recently, Description Logics have been used to fully
characterise the semantic issues involved in the interpretation phase. In this
Chapter the various proposals appeared in the literature about the use of
Description Logics for natural language processing will be analysed. 

<h3><a NAME="Chapter16">Chapter 16: Description Logics for Data Bases</a></h3>

Authors: <b>Alex Borgida, Maurizio Lenzerini, Riccardo Rosati</b>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

In contrast to the relatively complex information that can be expressed
in DL ABoxes (which we might call knowledge/information), databases and
other sources such as files, semi-structured data, and the World Wide
Web provide rather simpler data, which must however be managed
effectively.  This chapter surveys the major classes of application of
Description Logics and their reasoning facilities to the issues of data
management, including: (i) expressing the conceptual domain
model/ontology of the data source, (ii) integrating multiple data
sources, and (iii) expressing and evaluating queries. In each case we
utilize the standard properties of DLs, such as the ability to express
ontologies at a level closer to that of human conceptualization (e.g.,
representing conceptual schemas), determining consistency of descriptions
(e.g., determining if a query or the integration of some schemas is
consistent), and automatically classifying descriptions that are
definitions (e.g., queries are really definitions, so we can classify
them and determine subsumption between them).
