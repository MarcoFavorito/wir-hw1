<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
<br>
Many applications today are based on very large networks, e.g. networks in
traffic engineering, communication or the WWW. For the solution of
algorithmic problems in such networks, often more than just the adaption
of known algorithms is required. Some fields of application, which have
not been studied so far from an algorithmic point of view also lead to
interesting new algorithmic questions. Beside the design of very efficient
algorithms for problems in large networks, visualization of such networks
plays an importand role for the exploration and understanding of their
structure.

In this talk, some examples from traffic engineering and social network
analysis are presented, where large and complex networks are involved.  
We will talk about speed-up techniques for shortest paths computations for
time table information in public transport, layout algorithms for the
visualization of time table data, and new algorithms for the construction
of visualizations of social networks supporting the network analysis.
