  In this paper, we focus our attention on Representation of Linguistic
  Negation of Nuanced Properties in Knowledge-Based Systems. Our
  Approach is based upon a Similarity Relation between Nuanced Properties
  through their corresponding Fuzzy Sets. By using an interactive Choice
  Strategy, the User can explain the intended meaning of Linguistic Negations.
  This Model improves the abilities in Knowledge Management in that a
  premise or conclusion of a Classical Rule can include Linguistic Negations.
