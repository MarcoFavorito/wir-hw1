<P>
We consider the general case for camera motion (6 dof) and with general
objects in the views.

<br><br>
<P>
The reference system is fixed as follows:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>the origin is the lens center of the first left camera,<br><br>
<li>the X axis connects the lens centers of the left cameras,<br><br>
<li>the XZ plane contains the optical axis of the first left camera.
</ol>
</P>

<br>

<P>Camera motion is described by the 6 variables:
Th<sub>1</sub>, Rho<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, Th<sub>2</sub>, Rho<sub>2</sub>,
and Phi<sub>2</sub> (all angles except for X<sub>2</sub>).
</P>

<br><br>

<P>The new idea is to consider the camera motion problem as a stereo problem, 
in which the objective is to transform the images as they were taken by 
a <b>virtual large baseline stereo rig in a standard setting</b>.<br><br>
In other words, instead of using just a few features in the images we
make use of all the pixels in the images<br> 
(data association is addressed by stereo correlation).
