However, these objectives     are contradicting in particular situations since the algorithm has to constantly     probe available bandwidth, which may affect its stability. This paper proposes     a novel congestion control algorithm that achieves high bandwidth utilization     providing fairness among competing connections and, on the other hand, is     sufficiently responsive to changes of available bandwidth. The main idea of     the algorithm is to use adaptive setting for the additive increase/multiplicative     decrease (AIMD) congestion control scheme, where parameters may change dynamically,     with respect to the current network conditions.  <P>This is a joint work with Yishay Mansour.  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>  <P>&nbsp;</DL>
