The DRS (Data Relay Satellite) System is a European Space Agency
communication system whose management is particularly complex. This paper
describes the basic algorithm and the main heuristics used by the DRS-Sched
a knowledge-based scheduler aimed at solving a conspicuous aspect of the
whole DRS scheduling problem. The particular problem model addressed
represents a peculiarity of the DRS-Sched. In particular, the activities to be
scheduled have a temporal flexibility over both their allocation and duration
intervals. Problem solving in DRS-Sched integrates domain specific predictive
scheduling heuristics and reactive heuristics that try to improve the current
schedule by locally modifying previous choices. An experimental evaluation
demonstrates how the system satisfies quality requirements connected to the
following relevant aspects: the satisfaction of the strong role played by the
priority in the DRS domain; the intelligent manipulation of the particular
DRS's activities; the implementation of the ability to flexibly orient the
system towards different optimum objectives.
