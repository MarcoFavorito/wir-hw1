Most of the work in default logic is about default theories that
are completely specified.   In this category are the proposals of
appropriate semantics for default logic, the characterizations of
the complexity of reasoning with a default theory, the algorithms
for finding consequences of default theories, etc.   Relatively
little attention has been paid to the process of building a
default theory, and most of the work on this topic is about
translating knowledge bases from other formalisms (such as
circumscription, autoepistemic logic, and action description
languages) into default logic.   This paper is about expressing
knowledge in default logic.   In particular, we assume that
defaults are initially formulated as normal, and are then
corrected using specific inference examples.
