                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The  problem  is
                   addressed of establishing the satisfiability of prenex formulae involving a single universal quantifier, in diversified axiomatic set
                   theories. A rather general decision method for solving this problem  is  illustrated  through  the  treatment  of  membership  theories of increasing strength, ending with a subtheory of ZermeloFraenkel which is already complete with respect to the 9* 8 class
                   of sentences. NP    hardness and completeness results concerning
                   the problems under study are achieved and a technique for restricting the universal quantifier is presented.<p>
