  <H2>Introduction</H2>
    A general overview of this field of research, with a special attention to the
non-specialist  reader,  has  been  carried  over  in  <A HREF="CACM95.html">[CACM95]</A>.  The  book  gives  a
general  but  comprehensive  presentation  of  the  problems  tackled  by  Artificial
Intelligence  research,  and  provides  a  thorough  yet  simple  introduction  to  AI
methodologies and techniques.  In the wide and open field of Artificial Intelligence, the research activities carried over by this Department have been mainly
focussed on the study and development of the following fields:


<UL>
 <LI>  <A HREF="kr.html">Knowledge Representation</A> with taxonomic and concept languages, both in
       terms of computational complexity and expressive power, with particular
       reference to Description Logics, Propositional Dynamic Logic and classbased languages;

 <LI>  <A HREF="nmr.html">Non-Monotonic  and  Non-Classical  Reasoning</A>  by  framing  its  computational and expressive capabilities and by developing systems for automated
       deduction;

 <LI>  <A HREF="abduction.html">Abduction</A> with the characterization of logical formalisms for proof procedures and semantics methods;
 
 <LI>  <A HREF="intell.html">Intelligent Systems</A> for modeling and support of autonomous agents, with
       a special focus on tutoring systems;

 <LI>  <A HREF="lp.html">Extension of Logic Programming and Databases</A> techniques, largely concentrating on integer programming, logic programming with sets operators
       and disjunctive databases;

 <LI>  <A HREF="plan.html">Planning and Scheduling</A> techniques for communication, temporal reasoning and networking.
