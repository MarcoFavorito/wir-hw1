In this paper, we study reasoning about actions following a model checking
approach in contrast to the usual validity checking one. Specifically, we model
a dynamic system as a transition graph which represents all the possible
system evolutions in terms of state changes caused by actions. Such a
transition graph is defined through a description formalism, based on process
algebras, that provides us with the ability to express in a clean and simple way
the concurrent facets in a multiagent dynamic system. To reason about system



properties we introduce a suitable reasoning formalism, which is an extension
of modal ~-calculus, a powerful logic of programs that includes P DL, CT L,
CT L*. The reasoning problem we are interested in is model checking instead
of logical implication (validity checking). Indeed, we verify properties of the
dynamic system by verifying the truth of a formula, in the corresponding
transition graph. This setting has several interesting features for reasoning
about actions. On one hand, it inherits from the vast literature on process
algebras tools for dealing with complex systems, treating suitably important
aspects like parallelism, communications, interruptions, coordinations among
agents. On the other hand, reasoning by model checking is typically much
easier than more general logical services such as validity checking.
