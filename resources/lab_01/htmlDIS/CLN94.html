                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The   notion   of
                   class is ubiquitous in Computer Science and is central in many
                   knowledge  representation  languages.  In  this  paper  we  propose
                   a  representation  formalism  in  the  style  of  concept  languages,
                   with  the  aim  of  providing  a  unified  framework  for  class-based
                   formalisms.  The  language  we  consider  is  quite  expressive  and
                   features a novel combination of constructs including number restrictions, inverse roles and inclusion assertions with no restrictions on cycles. We are able to show that such language is powerful enough to model frame systems,  object-oriented database
                   languages and semantic data models. As a consequence of the established correspondences, several significant extensions of each
                   of the above formalisms become available. The high expressivity
                   of the language and the need for capturing the reasoning in different contexts forces us to distinguish between unrestricted and
                   finite model reasoning. A notable feature of our proposal is that
                   reasoning in both cases is decidable. For the unrestricted case we
                   exploit  a  correspondence  with  propositional  dynamic  logic  and
                   extend it to the treatment of number restrictions. For the finite
                   model case we develop a new method based on the use of linear


                   programming techniques. We argue that,  by virtue of the high
                   expressive power and of the associated reasoning techniques on
                   both unrestricted and finite models, our language provides a unified framework for class-based representation formalisms.<p>
