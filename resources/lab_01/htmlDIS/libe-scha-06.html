Abduction is one of the most important forms of reasoning; it has
been successfully applied to several practical problems such as
diagnosis.   In this paper we investigate whether the
computational complexity of abduction can be reduced by an
appropriate use of preprocessing.   This is motivated by the fact
that part of the data of the problem (namely, the set of all
possible assumptions and the theory relating assumptions and
manifestations) are often known before the rest of the problem.
In this paper, we show some complexity results about abduction
when compilation is allowed.
