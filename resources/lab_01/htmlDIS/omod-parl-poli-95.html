The problem is addressed of establishing the satisfiability of prenex formulae
involving a single universal quantifier, in diversified axiomatic set theories. A
rather general decision method for solving this problem is illustrated through
the treatment of membership theories of increasing strength, ending with a
subtheory of Zermelo-Fraenkel which is already complete with respect to the
9*8 class of sentences. NP   hardness and completeness results concerning the
problems under study are achieved and a technique for restricting the
universal quantifier is presented.
