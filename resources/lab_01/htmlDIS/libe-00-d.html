In this paper we show how several different semantics for belief
update can be expressed in a framework for reasoning about
actions.   This framework can therefore be considered as a common
core of all these update formalisms, thus making it clear what
they have in common.   This framework also allows expressing
scenarios that are problematic for the classical formalization of
belief update.
