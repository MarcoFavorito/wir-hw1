Two main approaches have been followed in the literature to give a semantics
to non-Horn databases. The first one is based on considering the set of rules
composing the programs as inference rules and interpreting the negation in the
body as failure to prove. The other approach is based on the so-called
closed-world assumption and its objective is to define a stronger notion of
consequence from a theory than the classical one, where, very roughly,
negative information can be inferred whenever its positive counterpart cannot
be deduced from the theory. In this work we generalize the semantics for



negation in logic programs, putting together the constructive nature of the
rule-based deductive databases with the syntax-independence of the
closed-world reasoning rules. These generalized semantics are shown to be a
well-motivated and well-founded alternative to closed-world assumptions since
they enjoy nice semantic and computational properties.
