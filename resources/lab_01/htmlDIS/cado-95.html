Logic is one of the most popular approaches to Artificial Intelligence, as it
provides a language within which it is possible to express a set of basic truths,
from which other truths can be mechanically generated by applying some
rules. A potential obstacle to use of logic is its high computational complexity.
Logical inference is indeed an extraordinarily powerful computational device,
and problems in logic are known among computer scientists for their high
computational complexity. As efficiency of AI systems is important for their
success, if we are to use logic as the major tool for AI we have to deal with its
computational intractability. This book is concerned with computational
aspects of the logical approach to Artificial Intelligence. The focus is on two
strategies for achieving computational tractability in Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning. The first strategy is language restriction: the
language used for representing knowledge is restricted so that the
formalization of interesting cases is still possible, but resulting tasks are
computationally feasible. The second strategy is theory approximation: we
approximate a form of logic by using another one that allows weaker
inferential power but is computationally feasible even with a full
expressiveness in the language. As far as the language restriction strategy is
concerned, we consider a form of non-monotonic reasoning called minimal
reasoning, which is a technique developed in the AI literature as a tool for the
formalization of common-sense reasoning, now popular also in Database
Theory and in Logic Programming. Closed world reasoning and
circumscription are two forms of minimal reasoning addressed in our work. We
analyze the tractability threshold of several problems, finding polynomially
tractable cases _for which we give polynomial-time algorithms_ and
intractable cases. We consider propositional as well as first-order formulae,
decision as well as constructive problems, modeling several reasoning patterns.
