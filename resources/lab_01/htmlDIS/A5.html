  In this paper, an alternative approach to the induction of relational concepts
  is presented. The underlying framework relies on the concept of exception,
  an exception being a counterexample left within the scope of a description
  devoted to classifying examples of the given target concept. While trying to
  characterize the target concept, first an initial description is searched for.
  Such a solution must be complete, although not necessarily consistent. This
  means that some counterexamples are allowed to be misclassified. As
  counterexamples (i.e., exceptions) must be taken into account in order to
  properly classify them, the corresponding learning process is performed in
  several steps, each step devoted to coping with exceptions generated during
  the previous one. Eventually, the process comes to an end, usually leading
  to a description that uses a kind of Vere's counterfactuals to refine, at
  different levels of granularity, the underlying concept
