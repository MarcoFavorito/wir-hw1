  The aim of the paper is to formally relate logical Horn models and Bayesian
  Networks (BN) in the framework of diagnostic reasoning. This is pursued by
  pointing out similarities between the two formalisms at the modeling level
  and by introducing into BN's a suitable notion of derivation. We also
  discuss modeling issues underlying the choice of Horn-based models vs BN's,
  by making explicit the "completion semantics" underlying a BN. This
  correspondence between "completed " Horn theories and BN's allows us to
  formally justify classical diagnostic schemata adopted for BN's.
