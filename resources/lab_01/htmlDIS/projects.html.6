                <p>The current trend in the communication world suggests that 
                  an information system should offer continuous access to all 
                  information sources, from all locations, through various kind 
                  of devices (PCs, laptops, palmtops, cellular phones, TV sets, 
                  etc.). Moreover, users are interested in a wider and wider variety 
                  of services enabling access to any kind of data, also with transactional 
                  properties and complex interaction (home-banking, e-business, 
                  online reservation, mobile information systems, etc.). Then 
                  the problem to allow accesses to services from current user 
                  location and through different telecommunication networks with 
                  a given level of QoS arises.</p>
                <p>The goal of the MAIS project is the development of models, 
                  methods and tools to implement a Multichannel Adaptive Information 
                  System able to provide services with respect to different types 
                  of networks and access devices.</p>
                <p>Then the main problems faced will be (i) adaptivity, which 
                  provides flexibility even in presence of a variety of technological 
                  platform and user requirements and (ii) transactionality, which 
                  provides security and reliability also in presence of failure 
                  or service unavailability. In particular will be developed an 
                  enabling platform to build distributed information systems with 
                  the above specified features. Then the platform should enable 
                  the execution of the services also on terminal devices, that 
                  may consequently work in the systems as server, also in condition 
                  of network fault, with distributed mechanisms of service composition. 
                  A seamless behaviuor of the system should be also enabled, in 
                  order to perform the service on several terminals, adapting 
                  as far as possible the service to the device type and communication 
                  channel features; service execution on the user side should 
                  also be performed with transactional protocol. </p>
