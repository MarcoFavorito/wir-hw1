Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems (TKRSs) are tools for
designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages
(or concept languages). The TKRS we consider in this paper is of practical
interest since it goes beyond the capabilities of presently available TKRSs.
First, our TKRS is equipped with a highly expressive concept language, called
ALCN R   , including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and
role conjunction. Second, it allows one to express inclusion statements between
general concepts, in particular to express terminological cycles. We provide a
sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCN R    -knowledge
bases based on the general technique of concept languages.
