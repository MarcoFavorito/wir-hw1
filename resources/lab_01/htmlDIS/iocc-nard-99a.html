Knowing the position and orientation of a mobile robot situated in an
environment is a critical element for effectively accomplishing complex tasks
requiring autonomous navigation.  Techniques for robot self-localization have
been extensively studied in the past, but an effective general solution does not
exist, and it is often necessary to integrate different methods in order to
improve the overall result.  In this paper we present a self-localization method
that is based on matching a geometric reference map with a representation of
range information acquired by the robot's sensors.  The technique is adequate
for indoor office-like environments, and specifically for those environments that
can be represented by a set of segments.  We exploit the robustness properties
of the Hough Transform for recognizing lines from a sets of points in order to
define an effective and robust self-localization method for dynamic
environments.  We have implemented and successfully tested this method in
the RoboCup environment and we believe that it has been a good benchmark
for its use in office-like environments populated with unknown and moving
obstacles (e.g. persons moving around).
