In this paper we address ground logics, a family of nonmonotonic modal logics,
and their usage in knowledge representation. In such a setting first-order
sentences are used to represent the knowledge of an agent about the world,
while the epistemic operator provides the agent with autoepistemic
orintrospective knowledge. Ground logics are based on the idea of
characterizing the knowledge of the agent by allowing it to make
nonmonotonic assumptions only with respect to the knowledge about the
world, i.e. expressed by nonmodal formulae. They are characterized by a
fix-point equation which determines the set of formulae derivable from the
agent's initial knowledge and which can be applied to different normal modal
systems to obtain a variety of nonmonotonic modal logics. In the paper we
address the semantical, computational and epistemological properties of
ground logics. We provide a semantic characterization of ground logics by
defining a preference relation on possible-world models based on the
minimization of the knowledge expressed by nonmodal formulae. We analyze
the computational complexity of reasoning in ground logics, providing both a
lower bound through a reduction from quantified boolean formulae and an
upper bound through an algorithm for computing logical entailment. We
discuss the representational features of ground logics, in particular defaults,
and provide a thorough comparison with McDermott and Doyle's logics.
