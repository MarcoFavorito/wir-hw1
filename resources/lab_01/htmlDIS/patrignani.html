<br>
 The analysis of data extracted from the Internet poses new
challenges to the research community.  Here we investigate the problem of
determining the types of the relationships between Internet Autonomous
Systems. An Autonomous System (AS) is a portion of the Internet under a
single administrative authority, using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
to exchange routing information with adjacent ASes and thus contributing
to the IP traffic delivery.
  We follow the approach introduced in [Gao 2001], which uses BGP routing
information to infer the Autonomous System relationships. Such approach is
based on the observation that each AS-path (sequence of ASes that must
be traversed in order to reach a destination) contained in a BGP routing
table must be "valley free", that is, without a provider-customer link
followed by a customer-provider one.
  In [Subramanian et al. 2002] the problem of determining the relationship
of each pair of adjacent ASes while maximizing the number of valley-free
AS-paths was formally introduced and left open.
  We characterize the time complexity of the above problem, showing both
NP-completeness results and efficient algorithms for solving specific
cases. Motivated by the hardness of the general problem, we propose
heuristics based on a novel paradigm and show their effectiveness against
publicly available data sets. The experiments put in evidence that our
heuristics performs significantly better than state of the art heuristics.
