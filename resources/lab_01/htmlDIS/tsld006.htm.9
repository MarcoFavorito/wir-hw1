 <H1>Concurrency in a DBMS</H1> 
 <P><UL></P>

<P><LI><H2>Users submit transactions, and can think of each transaction as executing by itself.
</H2></P>

<P><UL></P>

<P><LI>Concurrency is achieved by the DBMS, which interleaves actions (reads/writes of DB objects) of various transactions.
<LI>Each transaction must leave the database in a consistent state if the DB is consistent when the transaction begins.
<UL></P>

<P><LI>DBMS will enforce some ICs, depending on the ICs declared in CREATE TABLE statements.
<LI>Beyond this, the DBMS does not really understand the semantics of the data.  (e.g., it does not understand how the interest on a bank account is computed).
<LI>Issues:  Effect of interleaving transactions, and crashes.</UL></UL></UL></P>
