Knowledge-based systems must be able to ``intelligently'' manage
a large amount of information coming from different sources and
at different moments in time.   Intelligent systems must be able
to cope with a changing world by adopting a ``principled''
strategy.   Many formalisms have been put forward in the AI and DB
literature to address this problem.   Among them, belief revision
is one of the most successful frameworks to deal with dynamically
changing worlds.   Formal properties of belief revision have been
investigated by Alchourron, G&auml;rdenfors and Makinson, who put
forward a set of postulates stating the properties that a belief
revision operator should satisfy.   Among these properties, a
basic assumption of revision is that the new piece of information
is totally reliable and, therefore, must be in the revised
knowledge base.   Different principles must be applied when there
are two different sources of information and each one has a
different view of the situation, the two views contradicting each
other.   If we do not have any reason to consider any of the
sources completely unreliable, the best we can do is to ``merge''
the two views in a new and consistent one, trying to preserve as
much information as possible.   We call this merging process
arbitration.   In this paper we investigate the properties that any
arbitration operator should satisfy.   In the style of Alchourron,
G&auml;rdenfors and Makinson we propose a set of postulates,
analyze their properties and propose actual operators for
arbitration.
