Graph drawing is receiving increasing attention both in the
applications and in the theoretical community. Its target is to
construct visual representations of graphs and networks, which play
an important role in software engineering, informations systems, and
computer-aided-design. From the theoretical point of view, graph
drawing combines flavours of graph theory, graph algorithms,
combinatorial optimisation, and computational geometry. The new system
will embody the solutions to several classical graph-drawing problems
that have been obtained in the last three years and that still have
not found practical implementations. Also we aim at solving strategic
open problems, whose solution is critical to improve the effectiveness
of the systems, such as planarisation (most of the algorithms use a
planarisation step), resolution-rules problems (to better take into
account the finite resolution and area of visualisation devices), and
dynamic maintenance of drawings (project drawings grow in a long
process of expansions). We also plan to investigate basic
methodologies for embedding and visualising graphs in <b>3</b>-space.
