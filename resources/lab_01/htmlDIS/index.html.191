    ART team</FONT></H1>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Azzurra
    Robot Team is the result of a joint effort of seven Italian research
    groups from Univ. of Brescia, Univ. of Genoa, Politecnico of
    Milano, Univ. of Padua, Univ. of Palermo, Univ. of Parma, Univ.
    of Roma &quot;La Sapienza&quot;, and the Consorzio Padova Ricerche
    which has provided resources and a set up of the soccer field
    in its Center in Padua. Our goal at RoboCup 1998 has been to
    provide a flexible and low-cost experimental team to make experience
    before undertaking a larger project. Our long term goal is to
    foster the development of research and education projects on
    autonomous mobile robots by exploiting the RoboCup challenge.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
    order to exploit everyone's experience we need to accomodate
    different kinds of players in terms of both hardware and software
    architecture. We thus have a first set of players that have been
    designed with a common basis and constitute the main skeleton
    of the team, but we also have another type of player, named Mo2Ro,
    which has been designed by the group at Politecnico di Milano.
    The ART team in action is shown in Figure <A HREF="ART.html#players">1</A>,
    where one can see the player Mo2Ro close to the ball, three other
    middle field players in the center, and the goal-keeper defending
    the goal. It is obvious that such a diversity raises several
    problems from both the organizational and development viewpoint,
    but we have considered to be an interesting challenge of the
    overall project the ability to design players with different
    features, yet capable to interact with the team mates. In the
    following section, we first focus the presentation on the first
    group of players and then briefly address the second type. In
    the last section we describe our research perspectives within
    the RoboCup framework.</FONT></P>

    ART Players</FONT></H1>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    design of the basic ART player has been mainly guided by the
    goal of achieving an open architecture where new hardware and
    software components could be easily added. In addition, we aimed
    at realizing a good development environment to carry on experiments
    in the field, thus allowing many different technical solutions
    to be tested.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    hardware architecture is illustrated in Figure <A HREF="ART.html#archhw">2</A>.
    The first building block is constituted by the Pioneer mobile
    basis and the second is constituted by a conventional PC for
    onboard computing. We have reached a compromise between weight
    and power consumption, where the player has enough autonomy to
    play games.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    third building block is constituted by a wireless high bandwidth
    connection that we consider necessary to have a development environment
    that allows the programmer operating on a standard platform (connected
    to the robot) to obtain accurate information about the situation
    onboard. The wireless connection supports also the exchange of
    information among the players, but it is not used to transfer
    raw data among the players.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    fourth component is the vision system which is constituted by
    a low-cost frame grabber based on the BT848. At RoboCup 98 we
    have used a very cheap color CCD camera with a resolution 380
    TV lines. On the middle field player the camera is mounted in
    front part of the robot, while on the goal-keeper the camera
    points at a convex mirror provinding a 360 <IMG SRC="img3.gif"

    remaining components are devices that we are able to connect
    (as indicated in Figure <A HREF="ART.html#archhw">2</A>) through
    the Pioneer input/output ports or through an ad hoc made board
    on the ISA bus. Aa for additional devices, we have used a compass,
    infrared sensors, a bumper for the goal keeper and a kicker for
    the middle field player. The kicker, operating with air pressure,
    allows the player to choose the direction to give to the ball.
    In fact, it is constituted by two independent devices that allow
    for a kick left, a kick right and a kick straight action, when
    they are used simoultaneously. We consider the capability of
    performing kicking actions essential not just to pursue the football
    challenge, but to provide a setting where the knowledge about
    the environment and the game strategy play a significant role
    in the robot performance.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    software architecture is centered around two main components:
    LINUX and SAPHIRA. SAPHIRA is an environment that has been designed
    to develop fuzzy controllers and is provided with the Pioneer
    mobile base. The features of SAPHIRA that we have considered
    critical for software design and engineering are Client Server
    Architecture and the development environment suited for rapid
    prototyping. SAPHIRA provides a language for specifying concurrent
    activities, where the primitive activities can be either programmed
    or implemented as fuzzy behaviours and composed as described
    in [<A HREF="ART.html#KoSa96">6</A>]. We have experimented different
    strategies for designing the control systems, either by straight
    activity programming and by designing fuzzy behaviours.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure
    <A HREF="ART.html#archsw">3</A> shows the main components of
    the software architecture. The Local Perceptual Space (LPS) is
    the structure where all the information about the status of the
    system is stored. Specifically, the LPS includes a description
    of static objects: goals, walls, lines and field, as well as
    information about dynamic objects: ball and other players. The
    information stored in the LPS is used by the controller to drive
    the actions of the agent. The other modules shown in the figure
    provide some details on the process of acquiring information
    and putting it in the LPS. The sources for new information can
    be either sensing devices or other agents.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    module labelled Sensor Data Processing is dedicated to the processing
    of data gathered from the sensors and gives as output information
    about the objects in the LPS, such as position, speed etc. In
    acquiring information from sensors a central role is played by
    the vision system. We have tried various approaches to extract
    from the images information about the objects that are in the
    field and are represented in the LPS. In particular, we have
    developed a system based on HSV color filtering to identify the
    ball and evaluate its distance and angle relative to the robot's
    position at a rate of 10 frames per second.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    module labelled Interpretation has the goal of turning the object
    descriptions obtained by the sources into the proper representation
    in the LPS. This process is accomplished by taking into account
    the reliability of the various input devices, the frequency of
    acquisition and specific features of the objects. Information
    about static objects may lead to adjustments of the position
    of the robot, while information about dynamic objects changes
    their position relatively to the player's position.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Information
    about the status of the system can also be acquired from other
    agents, which broadcast the information gathered locally to other
    agents. To this end, we have designed a communication protocol
    suitable and efficient for the selected domain, and a high-level
    inter-robot interface dealing with the exchange of information.
    However, communication failures do not block the functioning
    of the robot, that is able of acting on the basis of the information
    locally available.</FONT></P>

    a modular, mobile robot</FONT></H2>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    second type of player, called, Mo2Ro, is a mobile robot consisting
    of two main modules: the electromechanical base, including the
    electronic devices providing power supply and low-level sensor
    management, and the PC. It has two wheels (diam. 12.5 cm) each
    moved by an independent engine, and a free wheel. Its maximum
    speed is 100 cm/sec, and it can turn on place. The payload is
    about 60Kg. It has bumpers, encoders and battery level sensors.
    It is possible to add to the base any kind of modules, including
    sensorial modules (sonars, cameras) and actuator modules (a kicker
    and a robotic arm). The add-on modules can also extend the size
    of the base, relying on an additional wheel and hinging on the
    base. A basic fuzzy control system ensures the accomplishment
    of movement commands given as position and/or speed setpoints.
    The software architecture runs on the on-board PC (a PENTIUM
    233MMX) under Linux operating system. It is based on behaviors
    programmed in C. The kicker is based on an idea drawn from Leonardo
    da Vinci's projects of pile machines. An engine mounts a cog-wheel
    some of which teeth have been cut off. The cog-wheel runs on
    a rack charging a spring-piston until a sensor detects that the
    teeth are present. Then the engine stops, and can be turn on
    again by a single bit command from the PC, thus leaving the spring
    piston to kick the ball.</FONT></P>

    goals</FONT></H1>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    research issues that arise in the scenario of the football game
    proposed for the &quot;Middle-size&quot; league of the RoboCup
    are discussed in [<A HREF="ART.html#Asada1998">1</A>]. Based
    on the kind of capabilities of the players we are addressing
    the following two issues: Sensing, Action and Control; Agent
    Coordination.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From
    the viewpoint of Sensing Action and Control we have tried to
    keep the player architecture as open as possible to make it easy
    to adapt different kinds of sensing devices and actuators. The
    underlying idea is to introduce many sources of information as
    well as different action capabilities. The approach proposed
    in [<A HREF="ART.html#KoSa96">6</A>] has been evolving in response
    to the need of controlling a much more complex robot, with different
    sensing devices, action capabilities and in a multi-agent environment.
    Many such aspects are not quite settled and we are currently
    proposing a possible extension through the software architecture
    outlined above. In particular, we emphasize the separation between
    the processing for acquiring new data and their interpretation
    according to the internal state of the robot and the knowledge
    about different sources of information.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However,
    we believe that in order to handle properly a variety of sensing
    and action devices, possibly trying to apply specific game strategies,
    a deliberative layer on top of a fuzzy control system is required.
    In previous work we have proposed such an approach, by relying
    on a declarative language for representing and reasoning about
    actions[<A HREF="ART.html#DINR96">3</A>]. In the proposed setting
    both static and dynamic knowledge about the system is used to
    generate a plan, possibly including sensing actions [<A HREF="ART.html#DINR97">4</A>],
    to achieve a given goal. The main issue we are investigating
    is to establish a proper and effective connection between the
    deliberative and the control level. Specifically, there is the
    need both to find a framework where there is a precise relationship
    between logical specification of actions and the underlying control
    system and methodologies for deciding which aspects of the control
    are better handled at the deliberative level. In addition, we
    are developing tools to support the development and debugging
    of the control system.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
    second issue we have addressed is coordination. We have developed
    algorithms allowing the fusion of the multi-robot sensor data
    (in particular of the perception of the robots' and ball position)
    to reduce the overall error. These components have been integrated
    in SAPHIRA.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
    a future perspective, we aim at the design and development of
    a novel distributed software architecture, not only to meet the
    RoboCup challenges, but also for more general tasks. This activity
    will build on the previous experiences in the field of distributed
    software architectures [<A HREF="ART.html#PiaggioZaccaria98">8</A>]
    and of robot cognitive modelling. Moreover, part of the research
    activity will also focus on the solution of navigation and planning
    problems throughout forms of analogical representation and reasoning
    [<A HREF="ART.html#Frixione98">5</A>].</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally,
    we are transferring the experience gained in participating to
    the Simulation League into the middle size-league on the particular
    aspect of getting an emergent collective behavior [<A HREF="ART.html#Pagello98">7</A>].
    The limitations in the ability of performing behaviors in the
    case of middle-size robots, makes the overall performance of
    the real multirobot system weaker than the one obtained by simulated
    agents. However, some basic cooperative patterns have been identified
    and complex support actions have been experimented.</FONT></P>
