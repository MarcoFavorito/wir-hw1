  In this paper, we consider the following form of temporal abduction: given a
  domain theory where each explanatory formula is augmented with a set of
  temporal constraints on the atoms occurring in the formula, and given a set
  of observed atoms, with associated temporal constraints, the goal is the
  generation of a temporally consistent abductive explanation of the
  observations. Temporal abduction is the basis of many problem solving
  activities such as temporal diagnosis or reasoning about actions and events.
  This paper presents an efficient nondeterministic algorithm for temporal
  abduction which exploits the STP framework [Dechter:91] in order to
  represent temporal information. In particular, we exploited some properties
  of STP, proved in [Brusoni:95], which allow us to efficiently prune
  temporally inconsistent candidate explanations as soon as possible. The
  pruning is achieved by interleaving abductive steps with temporal reasoning
  localized to the constraints on the formula used at each abductive step. The
  paper discusses the properties of the algorithm, providing both analytical
  and experimental evaluations of its performance.
