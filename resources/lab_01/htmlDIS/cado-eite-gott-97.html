Research in non-monotonic reasoning has focused largely on the idea of
representing knowledge about the world via rules that are generally true but
can be defeated. Even if relational databases are nowadays the main tool for
storing very large sets of data, the approach of using non-monotonic AI
formalisms as relational database query languages has been investigated to a
much smaller extent. In this work we propose a novel application of Reiter's
default logic by introducing a default query language (DQL) for finite
relational databases, which is based on default rules. The main result of this
paper is that DQL is as expressive as SO98 , the existential-universal fragment
of second-order logic. This result is not only of theoretical importance: We
exhibit queries -which are useful in practice- that can be expressed with DQL
and can not with other query languages based on non-monotonic logics such as
DATALOG with negation under the stable model semantics. In particular, we
show that DQL is well-suited for diagnostic reasoning.
