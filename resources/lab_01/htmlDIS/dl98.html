<H1>A note on encoding inverse roles and functional restrictions in ALC knowledge bases </H1>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>In this paper we show that it is possible to eliminate inverse roles
and functional restrictions from ALCFI knowledge bases, while
preserving the soundness and completeness of inference.  Specifically, we
present two polynomial encodings, the first from ALCFI knowledge bases
into ALCI ones, and the second from ALCI knowledge bases into ALC
ones. These encodings eliminate functional restrictions and inverse roles
respectively, but add enough information so as not to destroy the meaning
of concepts in the original knowledge base with respect to the reasoning
tasks. </P>
