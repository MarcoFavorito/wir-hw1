<P><UL></P>

<P><LI>Analysis:  Scan the log forward (from the most recent checkpoint) to identify all Xacts that were active, and all dirty pages in the buffer pool at the time of the crash.
<LI>Redo:  Redoes all updates to dirty pages in the buffer pool, as needed, to ensure that all logged updates are in fact carried out and written to disk.
<LI>Undo:  The  writes of all Xacts that were active at the crash are undone (by restoring the before value of the update, which is in the log record for the update), working backwards in the log.  (Some care must be taken to handle the case of a crash occurring during the recovery process!)</UL></UL></P>
