<H1>Reducing query answering to satisfiability in nonmonotonic logics</H1>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<P>We propose a unifying view of negation as failure, integrity constraints,
and epistemic queries in nonmonotonic reasoning. Specifically, we study
the relationship between satisfiability and logical implication in nonmonotonic
logics, showing that, in many nonmonotonic formalisms, it is possible and
easy to reduce logical implication to satisfiability. This result not only
allows for establishing new complexity results for the satisfiability problem
in nonmonotonic logics, but also establishes a clear relationship between
the studies on epistemic queries and integrity constraints in monotonic
knowledge bases with the work on negation by default in nonmonotonic reasoning
and logic programming. From the perspective of the design of knowledge
representation systems, such a reduction allows for defining both a simple
method for answering epistemic queries in knowledge bases with nonmonotonic
abilities, and a procedure for identifying integrity constraints in the
knowledge base, which can be employed for optimizing reasoning in such
systems. </P>
