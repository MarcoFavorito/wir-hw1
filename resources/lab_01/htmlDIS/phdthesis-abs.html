Based on this technique, we devise   a new deterministic algorithm which improves the best known bounds for fully   dynamic transitive closure. Our algorithm hinges upon the well-known equivalence   between transitive closure and matrix multiplication on a closed semiring. We   show how to maintain explicitly the transitive closure of a directed graph as   a Boolean matrix in O(n<sup>2</sup>) amortized time per insertion and deletion of edges.   Since an update may change as many as Omega(n<sup>2</sup>) entries of this matrix, this   seems to be the best update bound that one could hope for this class of algorithms.   We note that maintaining explicitly the transitive closure allows us to answer   reachability queries with just one table lookup. We also consider the case where   only deletions are allowed and we show how to handle updates faster in O(n)   amortized time per operation while maintaining unit lookup per query; in this   way we generalize to directed graphs the previous best known deletions-only   result for acyclic graphs. Using the same matrix based approach, we also address   the problem of maintaining implicitly the transitive closure of a directed graph   and we devise the first algorithm which supports both updates and reachability   queries in subquadratic time per operation. This result proves that it is actually   possible to break through the O(n<sup>2</sup>) barrier on the single-operation complexity   of fully dynamic transitive closure, and solves a problem that has been open   for many years. Our subquadratic algorithm is randomized Monte Carlo and supports   update in O(n<sup>1.58</sup>) and query in O(n<sup>0.58</sup>) worst-case time. </font></p><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From an experimental   point of view, we investigate the practical performances of fully dynamic single-source   shortest paths algorithms on directed graphs with arbitrary edge weights. We   also propose a variant of the best known algorithms especially designed to be   simple and fast in practice while matching the same asymptotic worst-case running   time. Our study provides the first experimental evidence of practical dynamic   solutions for the problem that are better by several orders of magnitude than   recomputing from scratch.</font></p><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
