<P><B>Abstract:</B> 
A robot has to visit all nodes and traverse all edges of an unknown
undirected connected graph, using as few edge traversals as possible. The
quality of an exploration algorithm is measured by comparing its cost
(number of edge traversals) to that of the optimal algorithm having full
knowledge of the graph. The ratio between these costs, maximized over all
starting nodes in the graph and over all graphs in a given class, is
called the overhead of algorithm for this class of graphs. We consider
three scenarios, providing the robot with varying amount of information.
The robot may either know nothing about the explored graph, or have an
unlabeled isomorphic copy of it (an unanchored map), or have such a copy
with a marked starting node (an anchored map). For all of the above
scenarios, we construct natural exploration algorithms that have smallest,
or - in one ase - close to smallest, overhead. An important contribution
of this work is establishing lower bounds that prove optimality of these
exploration algorithms.<p>
 
This is joint work with A. Dessmark.
