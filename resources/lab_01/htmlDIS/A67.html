  CBET is a software tool for the interactive exploration of a case base.
  CBET is an integrated environment that provides a range of browsing and
  display functions that make possible knowledge extraction from a set of
  cases. CBET is motivated by an application to training firemen. Here cases
  describe past forest fire fighting interventions and CBET is used to detect
  dependencies between data, acquire practical planning competences,
  visualize complex data, clustering similar cases. In CBET well rooted
  Machine Learning techniques for selecting relevant features, clustering cases
  and forecasting unknown values have been adapted and reused for case base
  exploration.
