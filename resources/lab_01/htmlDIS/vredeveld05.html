  <P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We introduce a model for non-preemptive 
    scheduling under uncertainty. In this model, we combine the main characteristics 
    of online and stochastic scheduling in a simple and natural way. Job processing 
    times are assumed to be stochastic, but in contrast to the traditional stochastic 
    scheduling models, we assume that jobs arrive online over time, and there 
    is no knowledge about the jobs that will arrive in the future. The model incorporates 
    both, stochastic scheduling and online scheduling as a special case. The particular 
    setting we analyze is parallel machine scheduling, with the objective to minimize 
    the total weighted completion times of jobs. We propose simple, combinatorial 
    online scheduling policies for that model, and derive performance guarantees 
    that match the currently best known performance guarantees for stochastic 
    and online parallel machine scheduling. For processing times that follow distributions, 
    we improve upon previously best known performance bounds from stochastic scheduling, 
    even though we consider a more general setting.</font></P>
