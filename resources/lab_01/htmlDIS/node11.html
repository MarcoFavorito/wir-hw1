<em> Frames</em> will provide support for the programming of
distributed-memory machines via a library of basic algorithms, data
structures and so-called programming frames (or frameworks).  The 
latter are skeletons
with problem dependent parameters to be provided by the users. Frames
focuses on re-usability and portability as well as on small and
easy-to-learn interfaces.  Thus, non-expert users will be provided
with tools to program and exploit parallel machines efficiently.  We
shall develop basic frames (which can be used to build more
sophisticated ones) as well as complex frames for, e.g.,
Branch-and-Cut, finite element methods, tree-structured combinatorial
optimisation algorithms, finite difference methods, sorting and
searching algorithms.  All these frames will be especially valuable
and relevant to industrial cooperators. Frames will be constructed
for different target machines

<P>
and common programming environments (like PVM or MPI). The focus, 
however, 
is on distributed-memory machines.  Frames will be adapted optimally 
to the target systems, contain efficient 
state-of-the-art programming techniques, and
therefore increase the acceptance of parallel computing. 
We remark that 
Frames are of industrial relevance. The Siemens AG, Munich, that is
also working in this field (TESSA project), and the Parsytec GmbH,
Aachen, are highly interested in this part of the project.
