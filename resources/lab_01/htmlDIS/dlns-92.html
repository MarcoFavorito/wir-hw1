It is a common opinion that subsumption is the central reasoning task in
frame-based languages (or concept languages). However, when concept
languages are used for building knowledge bases including assertions on
individuals, the basic deductive service of the knowledge base is the so-called
instance checking, which is the problem of checking if an individual is
necessarily an instance of a given concept. We address the question of whether
instance checking can be really solved by means of subsumption algorithms.
We do so by considering several languages where subsumption belongs to
different complexity classes, and we show that there are cases where instance
checking is strictly harder than subsumption. This result singles out a new
source of complexity in concept languages, which does not show up when
checking subsumption between concepts, and is due to the presence of
individuals in the knowledge base.
