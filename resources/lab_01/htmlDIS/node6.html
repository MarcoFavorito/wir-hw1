 We shall further develop and improve the LEDA 
library aided
by feedback from our users. Such feedback is well established through
electronic mail and a LEDA news group and has led to significant
improvements already (e.g., a twofold increase in the speed of the
LEDA graph data type). Our main emphasis will be placed on improved
information dissemination, reliability, dynamic graph algorithms and
approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems.  On the theoretical
side we plan to work on a theory of constant factors; this theory
should allow one to predict the actual running time of actual programs
on actual machines within a factor of two.  A significant part of LEDA
is now so mature that, on the one hand, several companies have made it
the basis of serious software development, and, on the other hand, it
is no longer a scientific challenge to maintain it. The recently
founded LEDA GmbH distributes and maintains these parts of LEDA and
develops MS-DOS and Windows versions of it.  We shall keep close ties
with this company and act as consultants for it.
