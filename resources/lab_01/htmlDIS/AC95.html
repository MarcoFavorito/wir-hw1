                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>The  DRS  (Data
                   Relay Satellite) System is a European Space Agency communication system whose management is particularly complex. Nevertheless the particular domain of application is an example of
                   problems that are becoming quite common in the communication
                   scenarios enables by current technology. This paper describes a
                   system named DRS-Sched, a knowledge-based scheduler aimed at
                   solving a conspicuous aspect of the whole DRS scheduling problem.  In  particular,  the  problem  model  addressed  is  rather  distinctive: the activities to be scheduled have a temporal flexibility
                   over both their allocation and duration intervals, and temporal
                   preference functions over the allocation interval. Problem solving
                   in  DRS-Sched  integrates  domain  specific  predictive  scheduling
                   heuristics,  that  built  a  solution  using  a  least  commitment  approach, and reactive heuristics, that try to improve the current
                   schedule  by  locally  modifying  previous  choices  when  a  particular class of conflicts arises. The paper describes the problems
                   addressed and the basic algorithm and heuristics used in the current  release  of  the  system.  An  experimental  evaluation  is  also
                   presented showing how the system satisfies quality requirements
                   connected to different relevant aspects of the project.<p>
