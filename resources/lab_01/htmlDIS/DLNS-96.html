Description Logics stem from Semantic Networks and Frames. They deal with
the representation of structured concepts, and reasoning with them. The
structure of a concept is described using a language, called concept language,
comprising boolean operators (conjunction, disjunction, negation) and various
forms of quantification over the attributes (or, roles) of the given concept. A
noticeable difference with other structuring formalisms is that also roles can be
given some internal structure, e.g. a role can be expressed as a conjunction of
two other roles. We survey techniques for reasoning, and computational
complexity of reasoning problems in Description Logics, referring to four
different settings: 1) reasoning with plain concept expressions; 2) reasoning
with instances of concepts; 3) reasoning with axioms expressing properties of
concepts; 4) reasoning with both instances of concepts and axioms. In the end
of the paper, we mention important aspects of Description Logics not dealt
within this survey.
