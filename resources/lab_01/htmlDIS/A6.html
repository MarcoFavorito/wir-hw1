  In this paper, we propose and evaluate the use of an incomplete
  backtracking strategy for solving job shop scheduling problems with
  non-relaxable deadlines and complex metric constraints. Previous research
  in constraint satisfaction scheduling has developed highly effective,
  heuristics for this class of problems based on simple measures of temporal
  sequencing flexibility. However, they are not infallible, and the possibility of
  search failure raises in the so called phase transition region, where a
  problem changes to being soluble to insoluble and where it is reasonable to
  conjecture there are the hardest problems. Chronological backtracking is
  one possibility to find a solution to this type of problems, but such
  systematicity generally implies high computational cost. We instead design
  an incomplete backtracking procedure based on the intuition that it is more
  productive to deviate from the sistematic chronological backtracking search
  in cases where the heuristic is more knowledgeable, and likewise better to
  follow the sistematic search when heuristic is less informed. Experimental
  results on job shop scheduling CSPs of increasing size demonstrate
  comparative advantage over complete chronological backtracking.
