<P>Data integration is the problem of providing users with
a unified view of heterogeneous data sources, called <i>global
schema</i>. In general, data at the sources may result incomplete in
providing answers to queries issued to a data integration system,
and may be inconsistent with respect to integrity constraints
expressed over the global schema. In this paper we present a
general semantics for data integration in the presence of
incomplete information sources and inconsistency of data with
respect to constraints of a general form over the global schema.
We define a method for query processing under the above semantics,
when the constraints over the global schema are key constraints
and foreign key constraints, and characterize the computational
complexity of the query processing problem in such a setting.
