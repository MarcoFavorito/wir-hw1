The definition of concepts is a central problem in commonsense reasoning.
Many themes in nonmonotonic reasoning concern implicit and explicit
definability. Implicit definability in nonmonotonic logic is always relative to
the context - the current theory of the world. We show that fixed point
equations provide a generalization of explicit definability, which correctly
captures the relativized context. Theories expressed within this logical
framework provide implicit definitions of concepts. Moreover, it is possible to
derive these fixed points entirely within the logic.
