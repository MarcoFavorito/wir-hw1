<CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>In this paper we
study  the  process  of  multi-agent  reinforcement  learning  in  the
context of load balancing in a distributed system without use of
either  central  coordination  or  explicit  communication.  We  first
define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and
the purely local information available to individual agents. Given
this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and how they affect the
system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive
load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and expose various
phenomena related to the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in
that context. In addition, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even deteriorate, the system
efficiency.<p>
