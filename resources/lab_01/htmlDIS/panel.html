A user's perspective on distributed simulation</font></font></b>

<b>
<font size=+2>Overview:</font> Describe, from a user's perspective, the hard
and/or interesting aspects of applying distributed simulation
for analysis, acquisition or training.  Provide insights with
respect to areas where research can make life easier for the
user of distributed simulation. 

<p>
<font size=+2>Motivation:</font>  The PADS community is largely a collection of
 academic researchers who have been involved primarily with
 algorithms/techniques for efficient synchronization of
 parallel/distributed discrete event simulation processes.
 These are the hardcore Time Warp and Chandy-Misra-Byant
 folks.  The synchronization problem, however, seems largely
 to have been solved.  Many of the recent workshops have been
 populated mostly with papers that are "fine-tuning" existing
 approaches, e.g. pushing known synchronization algorithms
 down into network interface cards.  While applications of
 their synchronization algorithms are flourishing (e.g.
 telecommunications) these papers are presented at
 applications-oriented conferences (e.g. MASCOTS).  PADS
 remains dedicated to the "core" technology/algorithm issues.
 As the synchronization problem becomes well-solved, the
 existence of PADS as annual gathering of learned researchers
 is threatened.  Our objective in organizing the panel is to
 attempt to identify some challenging "core" distributed
 simulation technology issues that may offer the PADS research
 community a "life after synchronization".
