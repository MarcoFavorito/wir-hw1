It is generally believed that Moore's     Law using current technologies will end in one to two decades because of both     physical and economic limits. One candidate for the future is quantum computation.     To date there have been two major algorithms for discrete problems on quantum     computers that are significantly better than on classical computers: Shor's     factorization and Grover's data search algorithms. But numerous problems in     science and engineering have continuous mathematical models. Examples of such     models include high dimensional integrals, path integrals, partial differential     and integral equations, and continuous optimization. We use classical continuous     complexity to:</font></P></DL><ul>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Identify problems which are hard     for classical computers.

We   seek quantum algorithms which require only a modest number of qubits. Future   research directions will be indicated.</font>   <dt>&nbsp;</dt></DL>
