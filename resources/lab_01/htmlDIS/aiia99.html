<H2>Abstract </H2>
<P>
Logical approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning have been developed within
different technical settings, thus making it difficult to establish
correspondences among them and to identify common underlying principles.
In this paper we argue that the most well-known nonmonotonic reasoning
formalisms are actually characterized by two closure assumptions: a minimal
knowledge assumption and an autoepistemic assumption.  We justify this
thesis by introducing generalized default logic (GDL), obtained through
a simple and natural generalization of Reiter's default logic, which fully
captures both closure assumptions.  We then analyze the relationship
between GDL and nonmonotonic modal logics, in particular Moore's
autoepistemic logic and Lifschitz's logic of minimal knowledge and negation
as failure, showing the existence of a full correspondence between these
modal formalisms and GDL.  Such a correspondence gives us a unified
reading of nonmonotonic reasoning formalisms in terms of the above two
assumptions; in particular, it clarifies the relationship between default
and autoepistemic logic.</P>
