<h1>Reasoning about minimal knowledge
in nonmonotonic modal logics</h1>

<h2>Abstract </h2>

<p>
We study the problem of embedding Halpern and Moses's modal logic of
minimal knowledge states into two families of modal formalisms for
nonmonotonic reasoning, McDermott and Doyle's nonmonotonic modal logics and
ground nonmonotonic modal logics.  First, we prove that Halpern and Moses's
logic can be embedded into all ground logics; moreover, the translation
employed allows for establishing a lower bound for the problem of skeptical
reasoning in all ground logics. Then, we show a translation of Halpern and
Moses's logic into a significant subset of McDermott and Doyle's
formalisms. Such a translation both indicates the ability of Halpern and
Moses's logic of expressing minimal knowledge states in a more compact way
than McDermott and Doyle's logics, and allows for a comparison of the
epistemological properties of such nonmonotonic modal formalisms.
