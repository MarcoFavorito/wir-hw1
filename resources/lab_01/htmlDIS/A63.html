  Recurrent neural networks are powerful learning machines capable of
  processing sequences. A recent extension of these machines can conveniently
  be used to process also general data structures like trees and graphs, which
  opens the doors to a number of new very interesting applications previously
  unexplored. In this paper, we show that when the problem of learning is
  restricted to purely symbolic data structures, like trees, the continuous
  representation developed after learning can also be given a symbolic
  interpretation. In particular, we show that a proper quantization of the
  neuron activation trajectory makes it possible to induce tree automata. We
  present preliminary experiments for small-size problems that, however, are
  very promising, especially when considering that this methodology is very
  robust with respect to accidental or malicious corruption of the learning set.
