Since the earliest formalisation of default logic by Reiter many contributions
to this appealing approach to nonmonotonic reasoning have been given. The
different formalisations are here presented in a general framework that gathers
the basic notions, concepts and constructions underlying default logic. Our
view is to interpret defaults as special rules that impose a restriction on the
juxtaposition of monotonic Hilbert-style proofs of a given logic L. We propose
to describe default logic as a logic where the juxtaposition of default proofs is
subordinate to a restriction condition  . Hence a default logic is a pair (L,  )
where properties of the logic L, like compactness, can be interpreted through
the restriction condition  . Different default systems are then given a common
characterization through a specific condition on the logic L. We also prove
cumulativity for any default logic (L,  ) by slightly modifying the notion of
default proof. We extend, in fact, the language of L in a way close to that
followed by Brewka in the formulation of his cumulative default system.
Finally we show the existence of infinitely many intermediary default logics,
depending on   and called linear logics, which "lie in between" Reiter's and
Lukaszewicz' versions of default logic.
