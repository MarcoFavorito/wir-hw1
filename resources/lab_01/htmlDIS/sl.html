<h1>A sound and complete tableau calculus for reasoning about only knowing and knowing at most</h1>

<H2>Abstract </H2>

<p>
We define a tableau calculus for the logic of only knowing and knowing at
most ONL, which is an extension of Levesque's logic of only knowing
OL. The method is based on the possible-world semantics of the logic
ONL, and can be considered as an extension of known tableau calculi
for modal logic K45. From the technical viewpoint, the main
features of such an extension are the explicit representation of
``unreachable'' worlds in the tableau, and an additional branch closure
condition implementing the property that each world must be either
reachable or unreachable.  The calculus allows for establishing the
computational complexity of reasoning about only knowing and knowing at
most.  Moreover, we prove that the method matches the worst-case complexity
lower bound of the satisfiability problem for both ONL and
OL.
