Propositional Dynamic Logics (PDL's) provide a suitable formal framework
for modeling actions and reasoning about them. However, the basic language
of PDL's lack several features that are important for a sophisticated treatment
of actions. In this paper, we present a new logic that is obtained by enriching
the basic PDL with powerful modeling constructs that allow us to represent
determinism and nondeterminisms, concurrency, hierarchies, mutual exclusion,
backward execution, and non-execution of actions. We demonstrate, by means
of examples, the expressive power of the formalism. In particular, we show
that although nonmonotonicity is not generally captured by PDL's, our logic
is perfectly suited for exploiting monotonic solutions to the frame problem.
Finally, we establish that the proposed formalism is decidable, and that the
basic reasoning problems are EXPTIME-complete.
