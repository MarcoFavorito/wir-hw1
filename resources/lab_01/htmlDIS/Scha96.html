The high-school timetabling problem consists in assigning all the lectures of a
high school to the time periods in such a way that no teacher (or class) is
involved in more than one lecture at a time and other side constraints are
satisfied. The problem is NP-complete and is usually tackled using heuristic
methods. This paper describes a solution algorithm (and its implementation)
based on Tabu Search. The algorithm interleaves different types of moves and
makes use of an adaptive relaxation of the hard constraints. The
implementation of the algorithm has been successfully experimented in some
large high schools with various kinds of side constraints.
