Closed world reasoning is a common nonmonotonic technique that allows for
dealing with negative information in knowledge and data bases. Several forms
of closed world reasoning have been proposed in the literature, ranging from
the closed world assumption, introduced in the context of data bases, to the
extended closed world assumption, which is equivalent to circumscription. The
aim of this paper is to present a detailed analysis of the computational
complexity of the different forms of closed world reasoning for various
fragments of propositional logic. Such an analysis allows us to draw a complete
picture of the boundary between tractability and intractability of such a form
of nonmonotonic reasoning. We also discuss how to use our results in order to
characterize the computational complexity of other nonmonotonic reasoning
problems, namely nonmonotonic inheritance, diagnosis, and default reasoning.
