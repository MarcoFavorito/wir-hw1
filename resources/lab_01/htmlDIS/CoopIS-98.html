Information Integration is one of the core problems in cooperative information
systems.  We argue that two critical factors for the design and maintenance of
applications requiring Information Integration are conceptual modeling of the
domain, and reasoning support over the conceptual representation.  In
particular, we present a general architecture for Information Integration that
explicitly includes a conceptual representation of the application.  We illustrate
how the architecture can express several integration settings and existing
systems.  We provide various arguments in favor of the conceptual level in the
architecture and of automated reasoning over the conceptual representation.
Finally, we present a specific proposal of an integration system which realizes
the general architecture and is equipped with decidable reasoning procedures.
