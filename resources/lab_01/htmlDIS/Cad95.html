                   <CENTER><H2>ABSTRACT</H2></CENTER>Logic  is  one  of
                   the most popular approaches to Artificial Intelligence, as it provides a language within which it is possible to express a set of
                   basic truths, from which other truths can be mechanically generated by applying some rules. A potential obstacle to use of logic
                   is its high computational complexity. Logical inference is indeed
                   an extraordinarily powerful computational device, and problems
                   in logic are known among computer scientists for their high computational complexity. As efficiency of AI systems is important


                   for their success, if we are to use logic as the major tool for AI we
                   have to deal with its computational intractability. This book is
                   concerned with computational aspects of the logical approach to
                   Artificial Intelligence. The focus is on two strategies for achieving computational tractability in Knowledge Representation and
                   Reasoning.  The  first  strategy  is  language  restriction:  the  language used for representing knowledge is restricted so that the
                   formalization  of  interesting  cases  is  still  possible,  but  resulting
                   tasks are computationally feasible. The second strategy is theory
                   approximation:  we approximate a form of logic by using another
                   one that allows weaker inferential power but is computationally
                   feasible even with a full expressiveness in the language. As far as
                   the language restriction strategy is concerned, we consider a form
                   of non-monotonic reasoning called minimal reasoning, which is a
                   technique developed in the AI literature as a tool for the formalization of common-sense reasoning, now popular also in Database
                   Theory and in Logic Programming. Closed world reasoning and
                   circumscription are two forms of minimal reasoning addressed in
                   our work. We analyze the tractability threshold of several problems,  finding  polynomially  tractable  cases  _for  which  we  give
                   polynomial-time algorithms_ and intractable cases. We consider
                   propositional as well as first-order formulae, decision as well as
                   constructive problems, modeling several reasoning patterns.<p>
