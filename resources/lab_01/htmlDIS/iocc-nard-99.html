The architectures for controlling mobile robots are often devised by
decomposing the control problem into small task-oriented modules, called
behaviors.  The accomplishment of more complex tasks is achieved by an
appropriate combination of such behaviors.  One possible implementation for
behaviors is by means of fuzzy rules for defining the control procedures.  In this
case, the interaction among behaviors is characterized by a mechanism that
determines a combination of the desired actions.  In this paper, we describe our
experience in designing behaviors for an actual mobile robot playing soccer,
and a discussion, from a user/programmer perspective, on their
implementation by means of fuzzy behaviors and of a robot programming
language.
