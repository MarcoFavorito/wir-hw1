                   novel  approach  to  generate  prime  implicants  based  on  integer
                   programming is presented. A bijection among formulae in conjunctive normal form and 0-1 matrices is established. The problem of finding prime implicants is transformed into an equivalent
                   one that finds the solutions of a set of linear equations with constraints. This task is accomplished by searching for the solution
                   set of an equivalent problem of Integer Programming. A generative algorithm which computes all prime implica nts one  at  a
                   time is presented. The advantages of such an approach are emphasized by a comparison,  based on a significative benchmark,
                   with another method.<p>
