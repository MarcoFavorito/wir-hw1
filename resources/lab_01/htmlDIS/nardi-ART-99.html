Azzurra Robot Team (ART) is the result of a joint effort of six Italian research
groups from Univ.  of Genova, Politecnico Milano, Univ.  of Padova, Univ.  of
Palermo, Univ.  of Parma, Univ.  Roma "La Sapienza", and Consorzio Padova
Ricerche which has provided resources and a set up of the soccer field in its
Center in Padova.  We have developed the team within the framework of the
RoboCup Italia Project, with the aim of education and training of students in
the subjects related to the design of autonomous mobile robots, of developing
new research ideas and foster the development of larger projects in this field in
Italy.
