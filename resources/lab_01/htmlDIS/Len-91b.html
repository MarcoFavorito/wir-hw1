<i>Inheritance Hierarchies in Knowledge Representation and Programming
Languages</i><p>
The careful closed world assumption allows one to apply the closed world
reasoning to a specified set of (not necessarily all) predicates of the knowledge
base. In this paper we consider a subclass of inheritance networks, namely
those inheritance networks which can be expressed as a set of Horn clauses,
and study the complexity of reasoning about such theories under the careful
closed world assumption.
