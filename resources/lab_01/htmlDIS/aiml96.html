<H1> Minimal Knowledge States in Nonmonotonic Modal Logics </H1>

<H2> Abstract </H2>

Recent studies on the computational properties of the logic of minimal
knowledge states due to Halpern and Moses (also known as ground logic S5
ground) have shown that reasoning in this logic is strictly harder than in
all the most studied propositional nonmonotonic formalisms, in particular
with respect to nonmonotonic modal logics due to McDermott and Doyle.  In
this paper we show that the logic of Halpern and Moses is easily embeddable
in most of the modal formalisms of McDermott and Doyle's family.  The
translation employed provides both for an identification of the source of
complexity which makes reasoning harder in minimal knowledge states, and
for an analysis of the epistemological properties of this logic, as
compared to McDermott and Doyle's formalisms.
