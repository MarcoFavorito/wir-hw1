Query containment under constraints is the problem of checking whether for
every database satisfying a given set of constraints, the result of one query is a
subset of the result of another query. Recent research points out that this is a
central problem in several database applications, and we address it within a
setting where constraints are specified in the form of special inclusion
dependencies over complex expressions, built by using intersection and
difference of relations, special forms of quantification, regular expressions over
binary relations, and cardinality constraints. We study the problem of
checking whether q is contained in q' with respect to the constraints specified
in a schema S, where q and q' are nonrecursive Datalog programs whose atoms
are complex expressions. We present the following results on query
containment. For the case where q does not contain regular expressions, we
provide a method for deciding query containment, and analyze its
computational complexity. We do the same for the case where neither S nor q,
q' contain number restrictions. To the best of our knowledge, this yields the
first decidability result on containment of conjunctive queries with regular
expressions. Finally, we prove that the problem is undecidable for the case
where we admit inequalities in q'.
