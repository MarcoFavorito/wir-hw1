We present two concept languages, called P L  1  and P L  2 , which are extensions
of F L  - .  We prove that the subsumption problem in these languages can be
solved in polynomial time.  Both languages include a construct for expressing
inverse roles, which has not been considered up to now in tractable languages.
In addition, P L  1  includes number restrictions and negation of primitive
concepts, while P L  2  includes role conjunction and role chaining.  By exploiting
recent complexity results, we show that none of the constructs usually
considered in concept languages can be added to P L  1  and P L  2  without losing
tractability.  Therefore, on the assumption that languages are characterized by
the set of constructs they provide, the two languages presented in this paper
provide a solution to the problem of singling out an optimal trade-off between
expressive power and computational complexity.
