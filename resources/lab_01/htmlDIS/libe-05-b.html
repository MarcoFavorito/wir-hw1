Many variants of default logics exist.   Two of the main
differences among them arise from the choice between local and
global consistency, and the choice of whether or not to accept
maximally successful sets of defaults.   In this paper, we
characterize theories that do not depend at all on what makes the
semantics different, that is, theories for which these two
choices do not matter.   A result that is proved for such theories
holds not only for all the considered semantics, but also for
every other semantics that differs from them on the two choices.
